"[DOC] [TLE] History of Masters Golf Winners | GolfLink.comHistory of Masters Golf Winners | GolfLink.com [PAR] History of Masters Golf Winners [PAR] History of Masters Golf Winners [PAR] SHARES [PAR] By Steve Silverman [PAR] The Masters is one of the biggest sporting events of the year. In addition to being the first major tournament on the golf calendar (the U.S. Open, British Open and PGA are the others), the Masters is generally considered to take place at one of the most picturesque courses in the world. The Augusta National Course is in full bloom in mid-April and the tournament has marked some of the signature performances of the greatest golfers in history. [PAR] Most championships [PAR] Jack Nicklaus is considered one of the greatest golfers of all-time. He has more Masters championships than anyone else. Nicklaus won six titles during his career, beginning with the 1963 title and ending with his championship in 1986. In the years that Nicklaus did not win the tournament, he was known for staying close. He finished second four times. [PAR] Greatest margin of victory [PAR] Tiger Woods won his first major championship 1997 at the Masters. He did it in breathtaking fashion, winning the championship by 12 strokes over Tom Kite. Woods had been touted as the next great phenom on the golf tour when he turned pro in 1996 and he served notice in the 1997 Masters that he would deliver on that potential. [PAR] Three or more championships [PAR] For a golfer to win one Masters title is a great achievement. Two titles means that the golfer has had a memorable career. Winning three or more titles, however, means that the golfer is one of the game's all-time greats. In addition to Nicklaus' six titles, Woods has won four Masters and so has Arnold Palmer. Nick Faldo, Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead and Gary Player have also won three championships. [PAR] Great comebacks [PAR] The Masters has seen a number of comebacks where golfers who were trailing in the third or fourth round put on memorable spurts in the final 18 holes to win the tournament. The most notable comebacks were achieved by Jack Burke in 1956, who found himself trailing by nine strokes in the final round before coming back to win, and Gary Player, who was down by eight strokes in the final round in 1978 before he came back to win. [PAR] Lowest final score [PAR] Tiger Woods set the record for the lowest final score in Masters history when he shot a 72-hole total of 270 in 1997, 14-under par. Jack Nicklaus shot a 271 in 1965 and that figure was matched by Raymond Floyd in 1977. Sam Snead and Jack Burke hold the record for the highest winning score. Snead shot a 5-over par 289 in 1954 and Burke shot the same score to win the 1956 tournament. [PAR] About The Author [PAR] Steve Silverman is an award-winning writer, covering sports since 1980.

TV captured all the danger and drama of men’s downhill skiing during an outrageous two minutes at the 1976 Winter Olympics. [PAR] Austrian favorite Franz Klammer had managed to win three world cup downhills prior to the Innsbruck games, but top rival Bernhard Russi of Switzerland mastered the 1.88 mile Olympic course.  The reigning Olympic champion, Russi’s time seemed unbeatable as the piste turned into a sheet of ice.  Klammer drew the short stick as the final competitor of the day, with lengthening shadows and impossible conditions setting up an action-packed rally, indelibly captured by ABC Sports announcers Frank Gifford and Bob Beattie. [PAR] Klammer’s daring, go-for-broke effort — is he racing or crashing? — speaks for itself.  But another thing that strikes strongest in the video is the spectators.  Some 66,000 people lined the course to cheer their homeboy Klammer to victory.  In a “you’ll never see that again / what in the world were they thinking?” scene, the fans stand 4 deep at the fence, close enough to touch Klammer on his way down. ABC Sports was known for its penchant for stunt announcing teams at the Olympics, and former pro footballer Gifford and alpine ski enthusiast Beattie firmly established the tradition of Olympic broadcast hype with one of the classic calls of the ’70s.  But it was Klammer himself who redefined the old sports cliche “in dramatic fashion” with a courageous run at Innsbruck.

His first 3 big films ""A Fistful Of Dollars"", ""For A Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, The Bad, & the Ugly"" were Spanish/Italian/German co-productions and, therefore, not originally produced in English.

When Dale Evans was signed to be the co-star of Roy Rogers , the studio was under the impression, she being from Texas, was proficient in horsemanship.  However, she had never before been in a saddle and was unable to ride.  Lessons were arranged and she became an expert rider. It was determined that the horse originally used by Dale Evans was too much a look alike to Roy Rogers' horse Trigger and was replaced by one owned by Hollywood animal trainer Glenn Randall.  Dale became attached to the gelding, purchased him thus ending a long search for the perfect horse. The buckskin Quarter Horse, with dark points, was actually faster from the blocks than Trigger which irked Roy and required retakes in scenes when Dale broke away faster speeding to the rescue.  The fact this horse survived its early life and made it to Hollywood is indeed amazing.  As a colt, he was rescued by a cattle farmer who bought him from a horse trader while being taken with others to a slaughter house.  He had been severely abused and was very mean.  The new owners named him Taffy and began training him to become a cutting competition horse and eventually the animal came around to assume a friendly and affectionate disposition.  Glen Randall always looking for animals to train, noticed him while appearing with his Liberty Troupe, saw him in competition at the Minatare rodeo in Nebraska and purchased the animal.  So-Taffy ended up in Hollywood.  With Dale Evans astride, and given the name Buttermilk, the steed appeared in all but six of the Roy Rogers Show television episodes that aired Sundays from 1951 to 1957.  Buttermilk died at age 31 and given the same treatment as his counterpart Trigger.  His hide was stretched over a plaster likeness and put on display at the Roy-Rogers-Dale Evans Museum then located in Victorville, California. The excellent mounting was done by Bishoff's Taxidermy of California.  Due to dwindling attendance and with the death of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, the museum was moved from Victorville to Branson, Missouri,  where it finally closed in December 2009. As of July 2010 Buttermilk was to be sold at auction. (bio by: Donald Greyfield)   [PAR]  [DOC] [TLE] Dale Evans - Biography - IMDbDale Evans - Biography - IMDb [PAR] Dale Evans [PAR] Biography [PAR] Showing all 31 items [PAR] Jump to: Overview  (5) | Mini Bio  (1) | Spouse  (4) | Trade Mark  (4) | Trivia  (16) | Personal Quotes  (1) [PAR] Overview (5) [PAR] 5' 4"" (1.63 m) [PAR] Mini Bio (1) [PAR] American leading lady of musical westerns of the 1940s.

He'd run like he was trying to commit suicide."" Lenore Spitz told a reporter for Time (April 12, 1968). [3] At age six his family returned to Sacramento, California, and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor, who mentored seven Olympic medal winners including Spitz. Before he was 10, Spitz held 17 national age-group records, and one world record. At 14 his family moved to Santa Clara so Spitz could train with George F. Haines of the Santa Clara Swim Club. From 1964 to 1968 Mark trained with Haines at SCSC and Santa Clara High School. During his four years there, Mark held national high school records in every stroke and in every distance. It was a remarkable and unprecedented achievement. In 1966 at age 16 he won the 100 meter butterfly at the National AAU Championships, the first of his 24 AAU titles.

"[DOC] [TLE] Enid Blyton - The Secret SevenEnid Blyton - The Secret Seven [PAR] In Defence of the Secret Seven [PAR] Article by Hari Menon (September 11, 2006) [PAR] Secret Seven! The name evokes disdain or contempt among many readers who are otherwise ardent fans of Enid Blyton. What did this ragtag band of four boys, three girls and one dog do to arouse such revulsion? [PAR] Okay, maybe I exaggerated. But for most of us the Secret Seven happens to be the least revered series in Blyton's canon. Is this because the books were written for a younger set of readers? Could it be the smaller format? The perpetual scowl on the face of their highhanded leader, perhaps? [PAR] I expect all these factors do contribute to the—undeserved, if you ask me—negative reputation the Secret Seven has among many Blyton fans. [PAR] And is it mere coincidence that the letters 'SS' have historical connotations that are not exactly pleasant? The series was written between 1948 and 1963, so such an 'inspiration' is not entirely far-fetched. But I think it unlikely—Blyton doesn't seem the sort who would take a sly dig at her own characters, even as a joke. [PAR] So, is the series really as juvenile as it's made out to be? Do the Seven have any redeeming qualities? Let's find out. [PAR] Cast of Characters [PAR] Peter: The head of the Secret Seven, Peter's word is Absolute Law. He usually decides the passwords, and seldom forgets them, unlike the others. Indeed, the easiest way to irk him is to forget the password or the SS badge (which others do with predictable regularity). Though he often acts like a dictator, he is annoyingly proved right on most occasions. The secret meetings are held in a shed at the bottom of the garden, some distance from his house. [PAR] Janet: Peter's sister. Co-owner of the shed and Scamper the golden spaniel, but that ends her stake in the Secret Seven. She comes across as a little brighter than the other two girls in the club (in one instance she sensibly makes a drawing of some tyre prints when the other girls only titter), but that's probably because she's constantly under Peter's thumb and doesn't dare to giggle quite so frequently. Her urge to dance in the moonlight comes in useful while trapping horse stealers on one occasion. [PAR] Jack: Jack is one of the more colourful characters. He's apparently second-in-command (though this is mentioned only once or twice in the books). He's also disappointingly gullible sometimes. In Secret Seven on the Trail, he believes the tall tales his sister Susie and her friends make up. He also forgets the Secret Seven password with exasperating regularity; indeed, Susie seems to remember it better than he does! To his credit, he is as brave and loyal as a right-hand man can be. [PAR] Pam: One of the two gigglers in the club. Perhaps her sole contribution to the club is when she ""interviews"" her grandmother in Three Cheers Secret Seven (and misspells the word ""absolutely"" in the process). She's a great friend of Barbara, for obvious reasons. Either of them is sportingly ready for a good cry when Peter starts shouting—at them or one of the others, it doesn't matter. [PAR] Barbara: Giggles, squeals and shrieks come naturally to Barbara, as they do to Pam. Indeed, you can't easily tell one from the other. Perhaps that's why Derek Lucas' illustrations show Pam in pigtails, while Barbara leaves her hair free. I used to consider her very pretty in those illustrations when I was ten years old. Ah, the follies of youth. [PAR] Colin: Though he can be easily confused with George, Colin makes some interesting discoveries. For instance, he was the one who spots the escaping thief in Secret Seven Adventure, and the one who forgets the book about ships in the cubby-hole up a tree in Well Done Secret Seven.

"[DOC] [TLE] W. G. GraceWilliam Gilbert ""W. G."" Grace, MRCS, LRCP (18 July 1848 – 23 October 1915) was an English amateur cricketer who was important in the development of the sport and is widely considered one of its greatest-ever players. Universally known as ""W. G."", he played first-class cricket for a record-equalling 44 seasons, from 1865 to 1908, during which he captained England, Gloucestershire, the Gentlemen, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the United South of England Eleven (USEE) and several other teams. He came from a cricketing family: the appearance in 1880 of W. G. with E. M. Grace, one of his elder brothers, and Fred Grace, his younger brother, was the first time three brothers played together in Test cricket. [PAR] Right-handed as both batsman and bowler, Grace dominated the sport during his career. His technical innovations and enormous influence left a lasting legacy. An outstanding all-rounder, he excelled at all the essential skills of batting, bowling and fielding, but it is for his batting that he is most renowned. He is held to have invented modern batsmanship. Usually opening the innings, he was particularly admired for his mastery of all strokes, and his level of expertise was said by contemporary reviewers to be unique. He generally captained the teams he played for at all levels because of his skill and tactical acumen. [PAR] Grace qualified as a medical practitioner in 1879. Because of his medical profession, he was nominally an amateur cricketer but he is said to have made more money from his cricketing activities than any professional cricketer. He was an extremely competitive player and, although he was one of the most famous men in England, he was also one of the most controversial on account of his gamesmanship and moneymaking. [PAR] He took part in other sports also: he was a champion 440-yard hurdler as a young man and played football for the Wanderers. In later life, he developed enthusiasm for golf, lawn bowls and curling. [PAR] Early years [PAR] Childhood [PAR] W. G. Grace was born in Downend, near Bristol, on 18 July 1848 at his parents' home, Downend House, and was baptised at the local church on 8 August.  He was called Gilbert in the family circle, except by his mother who called him Willie, but otherwise he was universally known by his initials W. G. His parents were Henry Mills Grace and Martha (née Pocock), who were married in Bristol on Thursday, 3 November 1831 and lived out their lives at Downend, where Henry Grace was the local GP.  Downend is near Mangotsfield and, although it is now a suburb of Bristol, it was then ""a distinct village surrounded by countryside"" and about four miles from Bristol.  Henry and Martha Grace had nine children in all: ""the same number as Victoria and Albert – and in every respect they were the typical Victorian family"".  Grace was the eighth child in the family; he had three older brothers, including E. M., and four older sisters. Only Fred, born in 1850, was younger than W. G.  [PAR] Grace began his Cricketing Reminiscences (1899) by answering a question he had frequently been asked: i.e., was he ""born a cricketer""? His answer was in the negative because he believed that ""cricketers are made by coaching and practice"", though he adds that if he was not born a cricketer, he was born ""in the atmosphere of cricket"".  His father and mother were ""full of enthusiasm for the game"" and it was ""a common theme of conversation at home"".  In 1850, when W. G. was two and Fred was expected, the family moved to a nearby house called ""The Chesnuts"" which had a sizeable orchard and Henry Grace organised clearance of this to establish a practice pitch.

[PAR] We take a look back at some of the highlights from the 14 Red Nose Days that have gone before this year’s event. [PAR] 1988 [PAR] The first Red Nose Day took place in 1988 and raised £15 million. [PAR] Mel and Kim sang the official Red Nose Day song – Rockin’ around the Christmas tree – sales from which totalled £76,610. [PAR] 1989 [PAR] Red Nose Day 2 took place in 1989. It was the first and last year that the event did not occur biennially. The second Red Nose Day was a much larger affair than the first, with 20 million people partaking in 70,000 activities across the UK. [PAR] On the night, Rowan Atkinson stole the show by appearing in a satirical mash-up of Newsnight and Mastermind entitled ‘Nosenight Mastermember’, which has become infamous for placing ‘The Belgians’ at the centre of a number of historical events. [PAR] 1991 [PAR] Nicknamed ‘The Stonker’ because the supporting single by Hale and Pace was entitled ‘The Stonk’, Red Nose Day 1991 raised £20 million and is notable for gifting us the legendary French and Saunders ABBA sketch, called ‘C’est La Vie’. [PAR] 1993 [PAR] Unquestionably the ‘year of the nose’, Red Nose Day 1993 saw sales of the nasal adornment sore to 3,307,000. According to Comic Relief, 72% of people in the UK took part in Red Nose Day 1993 in some capacity! [PAR] Interactivity shaped the entertainment output of Red Nose Day for the first time in 1993. A live studio audience was invited to vote on each consecutive scene of a special edition of perennially po-faced BBC 1 hospital drama Casualty. The results were predictably chaotic and rib-tickling. [PAR] 1995 [PAR] One of the highlights of Red Nose Day 5 was Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer sinking 75 pints while singing the Harry Nilsson classic Without You. The pair’s efforts weren’t in vain though, contributing to a fundraising total of £22m. [PAR] 1997 [PAR] Girl power reigned supreme in 1997, so it was fitting that one of the highlights of Red Nose Day 6 was a terrific pastiche of Spice Girls hit Who do you think you are? featuring comedy titans Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders and Kathy Burke. [PAR] £27m was raised in 1997, at the time the largest amount from Red Nose Day. [PAR] 1999 [PAR] Referred to internally as ‘The Record Breaker’, Red Nose Day 1999 didn’t just beat 1997’s total – it absolutely eclipsed it. An astonishing £35m was raised and hundreds of Guinness World Records were both broken and set, including the record for the most naked people on stage at one time, 101. [PAR] 2001 [PAR] ‘Say pants to poverty’ was the message behind Red Nose Day 2001. Members of the Great British public were encouraged to don their undergarments and wear them with pride on top of their outerwear. 2001 was also the year in which Ali G conducted his famous interview with Posh and Becks. In all, £61m was raised. [PAR] 2003 [PAR] For Red Nose Day 2003, Comic Relief introduced perhaps one of the most iconic red noses of all – the big hairdo. Each one came with its own sachet of styling gel to encourage buyers to style their nose’s hair as outlandishly as possible.

[PAR] Australian rock music has its roots in the 1950s and '60s when the style of music was growing in popularity around the world. [PAR] In the 1970s Australian rock bands became well known for classic hard rock. By the 1980s Australian music developed its own distinctive rock sound and became popular the world over. [PAR] First appearing in the United States of America, rock music was a fusion of white country and western music with black rhythm and blues music. These days, rock music is harder to define. Over the years it has influenced and been influenced by many other styles – elements of pop, funk, folk and world music can all be heard in many songs that are classified as rock songs. [PAR] The first Australian rock 'n rollers [PAR] In these early days, performers like Johnny O'Keefe and The Easybeats were easy to categorise as rockers, with songs such as Wild one, Shout and Friday on my mind mimicking the heavy-guitar sound and strong beat produced by rock performers in the USA and Britain. [PAR] Johnny O'Keefe went on to become the first Australian artist to appear in the Australian Top 40 (Wild one), the first to be signed and record for an international label (US Liberty) and was the first rock and roll artist to host his own radio program (Rockville Junction on ABC Radio). [PAR] The Easybeats, who met as immigrants at Sydney's Villawood Migrant Hostel in 1964, became famous worldwide. Other Australian rock bands to hit the big time during the 1960s and the 1970s included The Masters Apprentices, Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, Daddy Cool and Skyhooks. [PAR] Classic Australian rock [PAR] Jimmy Barnes onstage. [PAR] Image courtesy of Cold Chisel. [PAR] Cold Chisel formed in Adelaide in 1973 under the name of Orange. Their music was characterised by meaningful lyrics, catchy tune and the aggressive singing style of their lead singer, Jimmy Barnes. One of their classic songs, Khe Sanh, tells the story of a Vietnam veteran and his struggles after the war. Cold Chisel is also responsible for many other Australian rock anthems. [PAR] Perhaps the most internationally well known hard rock band Australia has produced is AC/DC. Formed in 1973, the band began with brothers Angus and Malcolm Young and Dave Evans. Although the band's lead singer Bon Scott died in 1980, AC/DC has lived on for over three decades, performing to packed halls and rapt fans around the world. They deliver no-nonsense, hard rock - the oddity being the school boy uniform worn by now legendary guitarist Angus Young. [PAR] Intriguing Australian rock and the 1980s [PAR] The 1980s was a decade when Australian rock gained confidence and world-wide attention. Nick Cave, Melbourne musician and lead singer of alternative rock band The Bad Seeds, said that before the 1980s 'Australia still needed America or England to tell them what was good.' [PAR] The 'Aussie Assault' on the world rock stage included bands such as Men At Work, Midnight Oil, INXS, Crowded House and New Zealand's Split Enz. Alternative Australian rock bands such as The Triffids, The Church, Hunters and Collectors, Celibate Rifles, The Saints and Laughing Clowns also contributed a great deal to the unique sound evolving in Australian music. [PAR] 'The fickle European rock press devoured the unusual sounds and, intriguing lyrics that captured Australia's intimidating landscape' that belonged to The Triffids and other bands. The Triffids were big business in England, Holland, Germany, France and particularly Scandinavia, particularly with their album Born sandy devotional. In Belgium, they played to 70,000 fans.

"[DOC] [TLE] The Fugitive (1993) - Rotten Tomatoes - Movie TrailersView All Critic Reviews (72) [PAR] Audience Reviews for The Fugitive [PAR] Somewhat based off of the 1960s TV series, this is the story of Dr. Richard Kimble, a vascular surgeon accused of murdering his wife, He claims a one-armed man did it, and, after surviving a spectacular crash during a prison transfer, Kimble escapes and goes on the run to cleat his name, and find out who actually committed the crime, and why. Things aren't so easy though, because hot on his trail is a determined team of U.S. Marshals, lead by the relentless Deputy Sam Gerard.   This is hands down one of the finest, most intelligent, and gripping action/suspense thrillers out there. The characters are well written, developed, and compelling, their motivations are clearly defined, the basic story, though simple, is imminently engaging and watchable, and the execution, primarily Andrew Davis's direction, is just top notch.  This is more than just a chase movie. It's a study of determination and perseverance. These are just great characters to watch, and whether it is Kimble, or Gerard and his team, you want to see them complete their goal. I saw this movie many times as a kid, mostly because it took multiple viewings (especially at a young age) to really understand some of the finer points and nuance. The other times though, it was just to marvel at the top notch movie making.  The stunts and chases are great, and I love the use of mainly practical effects and actual vehicles, like the train. That scene alone is just phenomenal. Top have it just be one of several stand out set pieces is an incredibly unbelievable treat. Speaking of treats, it's also a joy to see small roles filled by Julianne Moore (on the verge of mega stardom), and Jane Lynch, who was definitely appearing here before she became well known.   The acting is wonderful, with both Ford and Jones giving some of their best work. Jones got an Oscar for his portrayal of Gerard, and, while I do think it's a great performance, I  don't know if he really deserved an Oscar. Also, this film, for better or worse, really got him typecast too.   All in all, this is a superb thriller, and one of the best of both the 90s overall, and it's specific genre. Yeah, the rewatch value is debatable, and it sucks that the sequel wasn't quite to this level, but I'm just thankful that this film exists at all, as it is a wonderful reminder of how great the result can be when love, care, and effort are put into what could have been a generic thriller. [PAR] Chris Weber [PAR] Super Reviewer [PAR] Harrison is brilliant in this movie. Great storyline about a doctor who is framed for his wife's murder. He escapes from a prison van during a road accident and goes on the run to find the real killer. Great cast. [PAR] Candy Rose [PAR] Super Reviewer [PAR] Harrison Ford is one of those actors who can take any role, no matter how ridiculous it is, and turn it into something worth watching. He works in every movie he's in and The Fugitive is no exception. In The Fugitive, Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble who is accused of killing his wife, even though he didn't do it. The movie focuses him on the run from the police, lead by U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard. Gerard is completely intent on capturing Kimble and the only thing he wants is him in the hands of the law, not even caring about what Kimble has to say. The acting by the two leads is great. Even though Ford is on the run, you're still on his side and I actually sympathized for him because he's really a nice guy deep down and Ford does a superb job of conveying that. Tommy Lee Jones plays Gerard and he's just awesome. You don't really have to listen to him when he says he wants to capture Kimble because you can",What was the name of the doctor played by Harrison Ford in the movie The Fugitive?,['richard kimble'],a93cba8b55724d2f9ea8c3d7857eff5e,"[{'end': [222, 3119], 'start': [209, 3106]}]","∃x Doctor(x) ∧ PlayedBy(Harrison Ford, x) ∧ InMovie(x, The Fugitive)"

During our two week vacation last Christmas, he requested to watch ""Buzz Lightyear"" (his name for the Toy Story 2 video) at least four times a day. I think it must have given him a sense of familiarity and security as he had to adjust to unfamiliar places and routines. [PAR] Given his preoccupation with Toy Story characters, I was pleased that I had the foresight to buy my son a Pull-String Talking Woody Doll during our November trip to Disneyland (which we took without him since he?s terrified of life-size animated characters). He got the doll for Christmas and Woody has been entertaining our family ever since. [PAR] Meet Sheriff Woody [PAR] The Pull-String Talking Woody Doll from ThinkWay is 16 inches tall and is meant to resemble Andy's favorite cowboy toy in the movies, Toy Story and Toy Story 2. Woody has a large smiling plastic head (with a rather pointy nose) and brightly-opened eyes. His long thin hands, big brown cowboy boots with spurs, removable brown cowboy hat, and brown holster are plastic as well. The rest of Woody is plush fabric toy. He's dressed in blue jeans, a yellow and red checked shirt with big silver buttons, a black and white vest, a red bandana around his neck, and a shiny gold sheriff badge on his vest. [PAR] Woody's legs are very long in proportion to his body. Because they are stuffed with polyester fill, he can't stand upright for more than a second or so. He can be propped into a sitting position, though. Also, as in the movie, Woody's head can turn around 360 degrees. [PAR] So What Does He Do Beside Sit There and Smile? [PAR] He talks. Woody has a large white hoop on his back connected to a pull-string. When you pull it out and let go of it, Woody says one of 5 phrases: [PAR] ~ ""Howdy partner!"" [PAR] ~ ""Yeeha, cowboy!"" [PAR] ~ ""There's a snake in my boot!"" [PAR] The pull string is very easy for any child to operate and therefore has minimal frustration potential (always a good thing in our house). [PAR] Tucked inside a velcro closed pouch in Woody's back is a battery compartment, held closed with a tiny Phillips head screw. This toy takes two AAA batteries (included). We're still running strong on the original set of batteries after 4+ months. [PAR] Play Time With Woody [PAR] You might think that five short phrases would make this a boring toy, but so far it hasn't been for my son.

"[DOC] [TLE] Lewis Carroll and The Hunting of the Snark | The Public ...Lewis Carroll and The Hunting of the Snark | The Public Domain Review [PAR] ..or BROWSE BY TAG [PAR] Lewis Carroll and The Hunting of the Snark [PAR] In 1876 Lewis Carroll published by far his longest poem – a fantastical epic tale recounting the adventures of a bizarre troupe of nine tradesmen and a beaver. Carrollian scholar, Edward Wakeling, introduces The Hunting of the Snark. [PAR] Although best known as the author of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871), Lewis Carroll – the pen-name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a mathematical lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford – was also an avid reader and writer of poetry. He greatly enjoyed the poems of Victorian writers such as Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and Christina Rossetti. His own poems were varied – some just humorous nonsense, some filled with hidden meanings, and some serious poems about love and life. Probably his best known is called “Jabberwocky,” with its opening line of “’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves…”, and its many invented words, some that have now entered the English language, such as “chortle” and “galumph”. Such nonsense verse is as popular now as it was when first published. His more serious poetry, it must be admitted, is generally inferior to his humorous verse and often over sentimental. Between 1860 and 1863 he contributed a dozen or more poems to College Rhymes, a pamphlet issued each term to members of Oxford and Cambridge universities, and which, for a time, he edited. In 1869, he compiled a book of poems, many of which he had already published elsewhere but now issued in revised form, together with one main new poem, which gives its title to the book, Phantasmagoria. [PAR] One particular poem stands out from all the others that Carroll wrote. It has inspired parodies, continuations, musical adaptations, and a wide variety of interpretations. It is an epic nonsense poem written at a time when Carroll was struggling with his religious beliefs following the serious illness of his cousin and godson, Charlie Wilcox, who eventually died from tuberculosis. Although the poem concerns death and danger, it is filled with humour and whimsical ideas. Strangely, it was written backwards. After a night nursing his cousin, Carroll went for a long walk over the hills near Guildford, and a solitary line of verse came into his head – “For the Snark was a Boojum, you see!” The rest of the stanza, the last in the poem, came to him a few days later. Over a period of six months, the rest of poem was composed, ending up as 141 stanzas in 8 sections that Carroll called “fits.” [PAR] The poem concerns a quest by a crew sailing to catch a mysterious creature called a Snark. Each member of the crew has an occupation beginning with the letter “B” – Bellman (the Captain), Baker, Banker, Barrister, Billiard-Marker, Boots, Bonnet-Maker, Broker, and Butcher, accompanied by a Beaver. Their maritime map is an absolute blank. They reach an island, and the hunt for a Snark begins. But the quest is fraught with danger because although Snarks are not in themselves harmful, those that are Boojums are ferocious and will kill. The question that naturally arises is “does the poem have a meaning?” Carroll denied that he meant anything in particular – the poem was all nonsense – but that did not stop people asking him, and it inspired others to give it their own meaning. To some extent, the poem is about the relationships that emerge among the crew, and the interaction between this motley bunch of characters. All behave in odd ways, some have close-shaves, and one completely vanishes – caught by a Boojum. [PAR] The poem was entitled The Hunting of the Snark with the subtitle, An Agony in Eight Fits. Carroll originally intended it as a set of verses to be included in another of his children’s stories, but it grew too long and became a book in",Who wrote the poem The Hunting Of The Snark?,['lewis carroll'],ebc3dfcd062d4fee80db62448d039196,"[{'end': [241, 24, 184, 83, 588], 'start': [229, 12, 172, 71, 576]}]","∃x Wrote(x, The Hunting Of The Snark)"
"[DOC] [TLE] Blake's 7Blake's 7 is a British science fiction television series produced by the BBC for broadcast on BBC1. Four 13-episode series of Blake's 7 were broadcast between 1978 and 1981.  It was created by Terry Nation, who also created the Daleks for Doctor Who.  The script editor was Chris Boucher.  The series was inspired by a range of fictional media including Passage to Marseille, The Dirty Dozen, Robin Hood, Brave New World, Star Trek, classic Westerns and real-world political conflicts in South America and Israel. [PAR] Blake's 7 was popular from its first broadcast, watched by approximately 10 million people in the UK and shown in 25 other countries.  Although many tropes of space opera are present, such as spaceships, robots, galactic empires and aliens, its budget was inadequate for its interstellar narrative.  It remains well regarded for its strong characterisation, ambiguous morality and pessimistic tone.  Critical responses to the programme have been polarised; reviewers praised its dystopian themes and ""enormous sense of fun"", and broadcaster Clive James described it as ""classically awful"". [PAR] A limited range of Blake's 7 merchandise was issued.  Books, magazines and annuals were published.  The BBC released music and sound effects from the series, and several companies made Blake's 7 toys and models.  Four video compilations were released between 1985 and 1990, and the entire series was released on videocassette starting in 1991 and re-released in 1997.  It was subsequently released as four DVD boxed sets between 2003 and 2006.  The BBC produced two audio dramas in 1998 and 1999 that feature some original cast members, and were broadcast on Radio 4.  Although proposals for live-action and animated remakes have not been realised, Blake's 7 has been revived with two series of official audio dramas, a comedic short film, a series of fan-made audio plays, and a proposed series of official novels. [PAR] Overview [PAR] Blake's 7 is a science fiction television series that was created by Terry Nation and produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).  Four series (each consisting of thirteen 50-minute episodes) were made and first broadcast in the United Kingdom between January 1978 and December 1981 on BBC 1.  The programme is set in the third century of the second calendar,  and at least 700 years in the future.  Blake's 7s narrative follows the exploits of political dissident Roj Blake, who leads a small group of rebels against the forces of the totalitarian Terran Federation, which rules the Earth and many colonised planets.  The Federation uses mass surveillance, brainwashing and drug pacification to control its citizens.  Blake discovers he was once the leader of a revolutionary group and is arrested, tried on false charges, and deported to a remote penal colony.  En route he and fellow prisoners Jenna Stannis and Kerr Avon gain control of a technologically advanced alien spacecraft, which its central computer Zen informs is named Liberator.  Liberator's speed and weaponry are superior to Federation craft, and it also has a teleportation system that enables transport to the surface of planets.  Blake and his crew begin a campaign to damage the Federation, but are pursued by Space Commander Travis – a Federation soldier – and Servalan, the Supreme Commander and later Federation President.  [PAR] The composition of the titular ""seven"" changes throughout the series.  The initial group of six characters – Blake, Vila, Gan, Jenna, Avon and Cally – included Zen as the seventh member.  At the end of the first series, they capture a supercomputer called Orac. Gan is killed during the second series, after which Blake and Jenna disappear and are replaced by new characters Dayna and Tarrant. In the fourth series, Cally dies and is replaced by Soolin. Following the destruction of Liberator the computer Zen is replaced with a new computer character, Slave. [PAR] While Blake is an idealistic freedom fighter, his associates are petty crooks, smugglers and killers.

You wonder if it ever bothered Andrew, or if       he was used to being the tag-along.  [PAR] The truth is that       Andrew had quite a different personality to Peter . He was less impulsive,       more approachable, a man who thought quite deeply. He had educated       Greek friends who respected his opinion. Some of them asked to meet Jesus,       and Andrew introduced them to Jesus and his ideas (see James Tissot's       painting of the scene at right). He may have been something of a quiet       intellectual among the group of people who formed Jesus' core supporters. [PAR] His origins were       humble. He was a       fisherman who came from Bethsaida on the Lake of Galilee, but lived in       nearby Capernaum.  [PAR] But the life of a fisherman does not seem to have       satisfied him, for he was also a disciple       of John the       Baptist , the radical preacher in the desert, who told him about Jesus of Nazareth and called Jesus       the 'Lamb of God'.  [PAR] Andrew was a man       looking for something more than the steady life of a fisherman. [PAR] St       John the Baptist points out Jesus to Andrew, Ottavio Vannini [PAR] Andrew       meets Jesus [PAR] Intrigued, Andrew       approached Jesus and soon became convinced Jesus was the Messiah. When       Jesus later approached Andrew and asked him to join him in his ministry,       Andrew readily agreed.  [PAR] It is surprising       that the gospels do not make more of Andrew, because he was the first to       whom Jesus 'stated his case'. Jesus must have been fortified by Andrew's       belief in him when he underwent that life-changing event called the       Temptation.  [PAR] Peter       meets Jesus [PAR] Andrew was       perhaps the first to spread the Good News. He brought       Peter, his brother, to Jesus (John 1, 35-44). The first two disciples whom John reports as attaching themselves to Jesus (Jn 1:35-42) are Andrew and another disciple       - whom John does not name, but who is commonly supposed to be John himself.  [PAR] Andrew then finds his brother Simon and brings him to Jesus. Because       of this sequence of events, Andrew has been called 'the Peter before       Peter' because he is the first (that we know) to bring others to belief in       Jesus.   [PAR] 35 The next day John       (the Baptist) again was standing with two of his disciples; 36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, ""Behold, the Lamb of God!"" 37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. 38 Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, ""What do you seek?"" And they said to him, ""Rabbi"" (which means Teacher), ""where are you staying?"" 39 He said to them, ""Come and see."" They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. 40 One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, ""We have found the Messiah"" (which means Christ). 42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, ""So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas"" (which means Peter). 43 The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee.

There are arguably few adults today who can look back on the film and not recall their sense of loss as the scene of Mufasa falling from the cliff to his death, as well as the cries of sadness that escape from Simba as he pleads with his father not to leave him. Depicting the journey of Simba’s growth from a stubborn youth to a wise and beloved King of the Pride, The Lion King is truly a very special offering from the magical mind of Walt Disney. [PAR] Timon & Pumbaa [PAR]   [PAR]   [PAR] Despite being an American production, The Lion King still manages to connect and features its very strong African roots, not only in the storyline and the characters, but in their names. In an exploration of these African roots, we take a look at where many of The Lion King’s characters got their names and what they mean. [PAR] Mufasa [PAR] As Simba’s dad and the King of the Pride Lands, Mufasa is a wise and respected lion who is eventually murdered by his own brother, Scar. The name, Mufasa, is not just suitable for the Lion King, but also holds historical relevance for the Bagada people as it’s reportedly the name of their last king before they were dispersed by the English during the colonization of Kenya . [PAR] Mufasa [PAR] Simba and Nala [PAR] The son of Mufasa and the eventual saviour of the day, Simba is the young lion around which the story of The Lion King revolves. Suitably, his name, Simba, directly translates as the Swahili word for ‘Lion’ or in an alternative context, ‘courageous warrior’. Nala, the young lion who Simba plays with as a cub and later the lioness with whom he falls in love, has a name which is the Swahili word for ‘gift’. [PAR] Simba & Nala [PAR] Rafiki [PAR] As the seemingly crazy monkey who guides Simba on his quest for self-discovery, Rafiki is a character loved by many. The animal equivalent of an African medicine man, Rafiki helps Simba to get his life back on track after he’s given up hope of returning home. In Swahili, Rafiki means ‘comrade’ or ‘friend’, making it a truly suitable name for this lovable ape. [PAR] Rafiki [PAR] Other Meaningful Names in the Lion King [PAR] Pumbaa, the name of the delightfully funny warthog whose partners in crime with Simba and Timon, is also the Swahili word for ‘slow witted’. [PAR] Sarabi, Simba’s mother who has to face a harsh life when her husband Mufasa is killed by Scar, has a name which also stands for the Swahili word for ‘mirage’.

"[DOC] [TLE] Movie Review - - THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES - NYTimes.comMovie Review -    - THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES - NYTimes.com [PAR] THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES [PAR] By Richard Eder [PAR] Published: August    5, 1976 [PAR] Each time Clint Eastwood, in The Outlaw Josey Wales, kills someone, or is about to kill someone, or is on the verge of some other major policy decision, he spits. This is to establish the character. [PAR] Mr. Eastwood has established several pints of character by the time he rides off into the sunset fully two hours and seventeen minutes after the movie begins. A number of other characters are established by devices every bit as worn and dribbly. [PAR] A hard-luck but winsome Indian girl repeatedly gets knocked off her feet or worse; a sneaky boatman cringes and leers; a spry old woman bustles about with a broom, shrills out hymns, and grabs a rifle to shoot marauders; a doe-eyed young woman opens her eyes reindeer-size to convey fear, passion, or bashfulness; a young follower of the outlaw manages three distinct and radiant deathbed scenes on one bullet hole. [PAR] The Outlaw Josey Wales, which opened yesterday at various local theaters, is a soggy attempt at a post-Civil War western epic. Josey Wales, a peaceable Missouri farmer, has his farm burned and his wife and child killed by Unionist freebooters. He joins a gang of Confederate marauders, goes through the warconveyed briefly by a montage of war shotsmows down a platoon of Union soldiers, and flees to Texas with a price on his head and an array of vicious lawmen and bounty hunters after him. [PAR] It is a long exodus, in the course of which Wales kills a great many people and, despite his contention that he wants to travel alone, picks up a whole variegated convoy of stock characters. [PAR] They are tedious companions on such a long trip, especially because most of themPaula Trueman as the old woman, Sondra Locke as the doe-eyed daughter, Sam Bottoms as Wales's dying followeroveract beyond belief. Their lines don't help them. ""Clouds are the dreams floating across the sky of your mind,"" doe-eyes tells Wales. [PAR] Will Sampson, who played the Indian in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and another Indian in Buffalo Bill, does a blue-painted Navajo chieftain and gets to say, among other things: ""Your words of death carry iron."" Mr. Sampson has specialized in displaced-Indian roles. As a real warrior Indian he seems embarrassed. [PAR] Playing a civilized Indian who attaches himself to Wales, Chief Dan George has moments of dry humor and whole stretches of damp whimsy. Mr. Eastwood, as indicated earlier, doesn't act; he spits. He is also the director. [PAR] The movie tends to muffle and sell short whatever points it may be trying to make. There seems to be a ghost of an attempt to assert the romantic individualism of the South against the cold expansionism of the North. Every Unionist is vicious and incompetent, whereas Wales, despite his spitting, is really a perfect gentleman. [PAR] There is something cynical about this primitive one-sidedness in what is not only a historical context, but happens also to be our own historical context. To the degree a movie asserts history, it should at least attempt to do it fairly. [PAR] THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES (MOVIE) [PAR] Directed by Clint Eastwood; written by Philip Kaufman and Sonia Chernus, based on the book Gone to Texas by Forrest Carter; director of photography, Bruce Surtees; edited by Ferris Webster; music by Jerry Fielding; production designer, Tambi Larsen; produced by Robert Daley; released by Warner Brothers.

[PAR] Although The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a good movie, the real joy in it is watching two of the greatest legends of Hollywood team up and square off. John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart have two of the most distinct voices and on screen personas of the golden age of the movies. This film takes full advantage of both of them. Wayne plays a rough and tough gunslinger who does not take crap from anyone, while Stewart plays an idealist, pacifist. [PAR] As the movie opens, a senator and his wife return to a small western town to bury an estranged friend. The senator, Ransom, was made famous for being the man who killed the notorious bad guy, Liberty Valance. Most of the movie plays out as a flashback of Ransom telling the story to a local newspaperman. [PAR] Filmed in black and white, due to the fact that Stewart plays an old man and then in flashback a man just out of law school. Except for the close ups, Stewart pulls it off. The script gives him plenty of opportunities to pontificate and give a few speeches. Anyone who knows Stewart’s work can just hear him saying ""Liberty Valance."" In several scenes he gets worked up and George Bailey takes over. This movie works a bit like It’s A Wonderful Life meets Mr Smith Goes to Washington. The character of Ransom was perfectly suited to Stewart. [PAR] Wayne is likewise good. This movie utilizes his strength and this is the movie people are imitating when they do the Duke, ""Whoa, take 'er easy there, Pilgrim."" He says to Stewart. Wayne also has a dramatic scene where he gets drunk. In real life it was reported that the Duke could put them away and his Academy Award, for True Grit, was for playing a drunk. [PAR] For a western, this movie covers many themes. Wayne and Stewart each play opposite men, vying for the affection of the same woman. The movie gets a little political and patriotic. My favorite line in the movie is after Stewart finishes his story, he asks the newspaper man if he will write the true story. The writer responds, ""No, sir. This is the West. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."" [PAR] Did you enjoy Eric's review? [PAR] +5 [PAR] Scott : [PAR] Reviewed on: February 4th, 2009 [PAR] Wayne as Tom Doniphon represents the true heroes of the West and not the made-up legends who came after him. [PAR] The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence isn't just a good movie, it's a great one. Truly one of the greatest Westerns ever filmed and very unlike the classic ""Cowboy saves the day and rides off into the sunset"" type that were so popular in the 1950s and 1960s. It's a dark film that is tinged with a kind of sadness that I find very appealing. [PAR] That line you mention Eric about printing the legend really sums up this whole movie. You have Wayne's character of Tom who is of the genuine West. The last gunslinger hero you might say. Through most of the film he is dusty and trail worn. He isn't the marshal or acknowledged as a hero. He just is who he is; the big strong silent hero and he dies in obscurity. Stewart's Ransom is the legend of the West. To the people in the movie he is the cowboy who saved the day, got the girl and rode off to live happily ever after. And look at the scene where Ransom is nominated for the Senate.

[PAR] Did Jor-El have any other family on Krypton? [PAR] Written Feb 4, 2010 [PAR] Summary: Jor-El was a Kryptonian scientist, prior to Krypton's destruction. He was a member of the Kryptonian Council, and at one time, was its head. Although he was greatly respected amongst his colleagues, they ridiculed him when he predicted the destruction of the planet through his experiments. [PAR] Jor-El is also the father of Kal-El, the boy who would become Superman on Earth. Prior to Krypton's destruction, Jor-El launched Kal-El, as a baby, on an experimental spacecraft toward Earth, a planet he had previously visited. [PAR] Although he is now dead, a semblance of his personality lives on as a computer program within Superman's Fortress of Solitude. He appears when called for, and gives his son advice.

He truly cares for his family and even for the inhabitants of Earth. [PAR] In most depictions, Jor-El is a benevolent scientist. Very wise and caring for his son. In many versions of the story, he is unique amongst his fellow scientists (And, perhaps, amongst Kryptonians in general) in that he has more of an open mind to accept new ideas, and (especially in the modern versions) is sometimes the only Kryptonian capable of openly loving his wife and son. [PAR] Family: Jor-El had two brothers: Zor-El, who lived in Argo City and eventually became the father of Kara Zor-El, alias Supergirl, and a fraternal twin brother named Nim-El, who lived in Kandor. In several stories, Jor-El's father was established as Jor-El I, and his mother asNimda An-Dor. Jor-El eventually met and married Lara, daughter of Lor-Van, a young astronaut in Krypton's fledgling space program (which was soon permanently grounded after Jax-Urblew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons), and the two soon had an infant son,Kal-El. [PAR] History: Jor-El was once a scientist and high-ranking member of the Kryptonian Science Council on the planet Krypton. He was a protege of the eminent scientist known as Non and together they discovered that Krypton was suffering from severe geological disturbances - disturbances that threatened to destroy the entire planet. Jor-El brought his concerns to the Science Council, but they dismissed his assertions as a vehicle of paranoia and discord. Jor-El was also the architect of the Phantom Zone projector, a device that could teleport convicted criminals into an otherworldly dimension called the Phantom Zone. Jor-El believed that imprisonment in the Phantom Zone was a more humane method of incarcerating criminals, though he had little knowledge of what life inside the Phantom Zone was truly like. [PAR] Shortly before the destruction of Krypton, Jor-El and his wife Lara gave birth to a son named Kal-El. Desperate to save his son's life, he created a star-drive ship designed to take him to another world - a world where he would be safe and grow up to be strong and happy. Jor-El explored the galaxy in search of a suitable planet and sent out dozens of probes designed to collect various data. His research revealed that Kryptonians living in a yellow-star system developed enhanced physical characteristics including super-strength, speed and agility.",Who is Kal-El better known as?,['superman'],dadcd673b914422f969246479ce2f293,"[{'end': [1239, 136, 27, 973, 69], 'start': [1232, 129, 20, 966, 62]}]","∃x (Kal-El = KnownAs(x, ""Superman""))"

Billy Wilder’s comedy about two musicians who witness a mob hit and go into hiding by dressing as women and joining an all-girl band has one of the best closing lines in cinema. Jack Lemmon tears off the fetching wig he’s been wearing for much of the movie and declares, “I’m a man!” Joe E. Brown, the millionaire who has fallen in love with him/her, calmly responds, “Nobody’s perfect.” Perhaps, but that line is perfect. And so are Lemmon and Curtis. The former revels in the role, his character joyously takes to playing a woman. The latter is less proficient, but his stumbling, barely veiled masculinity works perfectly alongside Lemmon’s giddy girlishness.[DOC] [TLE] Jack Lemmon on Pinterest | Some Like It Hot, Billy Wilder ...1000+ images about Jack Lemmon on Pinterest | Jack o'connell, American actors and The great race [PAR] Jack Lemmon with Tony Curtis’ mom on the set of ""Some Like It Hot"" ~ 1959 [PAR] See More[DOC] [TLE] Tony Curtis!!!

"[DOC] [TLE] BBC Radio 4BBC Radio 4 is a radio station owned and operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) that broadcasts a wide variety of spoken-word programmes including news, drama, comedy, science and history. It replaced the BBC Home Service in 1967.  The station controller is Gwyneth Williams; and the station is part of BBC Radio and the BBC Radio department. The station is broadcast from the BBC's headquarters at Broadcasting House, London. [PAR] It is the second most popular domestic radio station in the UK, broadcast throughout the UK, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands on FM, LW and DAB; and can be received in eastern and south eastern counties of Ireland, the north of France and Northern Europe. It is also available through Freeview, Sky, Virgin Media and on the Internet. Its sister station, BBC Radio 4 Extra (formerly BBC Radio 7), complements the main channel by broadcasting repeats from the Radio 4 archive, extended versions of Radio 4 programmes and supplements to series such as The Archers and Desert Island Discs. [PAR] It is notable for its news bulletins and programmes such as Today and The World at One, heralded on air by the Greenwich Time Signal ""pips"" or the chimes of Big Ben. [PAR] Outline  [PAR] BBC Radio 4 is the second most popular British domestic radio station by total hours,  after Radio 2 – and the most popular in London and the South of England. It recorded its highest audience, of 11 million listeners, in May 2011  and was ""UK Radio Station of the Year"" at the 2003, 2004 and 2008 Sony Radio Academy Awards.   It also won a Peabody Award in 2002 for File On 4:  Export Controls.  Costing £71.4 million (2005/6),  it is the BBC's most expensive national radio network and is considered by many to be its flagship. There is no comparable British commercial network: Channel 4 abandoned plans to launch its own speech-based digital radio station in October 2008 as part of a £100m cost cutting review.  [PAR] In 2010 Gwyneth Williams  replaced Mark Damazer as Radio 4 controller. Damazer became Master of St Peter's College, Oxford. [PAR] Music and sport are the only fields that largely fall outside the station's remit. It broadcasts occasional concerts, and documentaries related to various forms of both popular and classical music, and the long-running music-based Desert Island Discs. Prior to the creation of BBC Radio 5 it broadcast sports-based features, notably Sport on Four, and since the creation of BBC Radio 5 Live has become the home of ball-by-ball commentaries of most Test cricket matches played by England, broadcast on long wave. As a result, for around 70 days a year listeners have to rely on FM broadcasts or increasingly DAB for mainstream Radio 4 broadcasts - the number relying solely on long wave is now a small minority. [PAR] The cricket broadcasts take precedence over on-the-hour news bulletins, but not the Shipping Forecast, carried since its move to  long wave in 1978 because that can be received clearly at sea.  The station is the UK's national broadcaster in times of national emergency such as war, due to the wide coverage of the Droitwich signal: if all other radio stations were forced to close, it would carry on broadcasting. It has been claimed that the commanders of nuclear-armed submarines believing that Britain had suffered nuclear attack were required to check if they could still receive Radio 4 on 198 long wave, and if they could not they would open sealed orders that might authorise a retaliatory strike.   [PAR] As well as news and drama, the station has a strong reputation for comedy, including experimental and alternative comedy, many successful comedians and comedy shows first appearing on the station. [PAR] The station is available on FM in most of Great Britain, parts of Ireland and the north of France; LW throughout the UK and in parts of Northern Europe, and the Atlantic north of the Azores to about 20 degrees west; MW in some areas; DAB; Digital TV including Freeview, Freesat",What was renamed as BBC Radio 4 in 1967?,['bbc home service'],546096e8b3b34375ae6d733e974d855f,"[{'end': [259], 'start': [244]}]","∃x (Renamed(x, ""BBC Radio 4"") ∧ Year(x, 1967))"

Driven to the brink with grief and anger, and having only a dog for company, he regularly puts himself (and anyone else near him) in harm's way, secretly hoping someone will put him out of his misery, something he has been unable to do himself.

[PAR] It was during the Great Depression that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow went on their two-year crime spree (1932-1934). The general attitude in the United States was against government and Bonnie and Clyde used that to their advantage. With an image closer to Robin Hood rather than mass murderers, Bonnie and Clyde captured the imagination of the nation. [PAR] Dates: Bonnie Parker (October 1, 1910 -- May 23, 1934); Clyde Barrow (March 24, 1909 -- May 23, 1934) [PAR] Also Known As: Bonnie Elizabeth Parker, Clyde Chestnut Barrow, The Barrow Gang [PAR] Overview of Bonnie and Clyde [PAR] In some ways it was easy to romanticize Bonnie and Clyde. They were a young couple in love who were out on the open road, running from the ""big, bad law"" who were ""out to get them."" Clyde's impressive driving skill got the gang out of many close calls, while Bonnie's poetry won the hearts of many. (Clyde loved Fords so much, he even wrote a letter to Henry Ford himself!) [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Profile of Bonnie and Clyde [PAR] Although Bonnie and Clyde had killed people, they were equally known for kidnapping policemen who had caught up to them and then driving them around for hours only to release them, unharmed, hundreds of miles away. The two seemed like they were on an adventure, having fun while easily side-stepping the law. [PAR] As with any image, the truth behind Bonnie and Clyde was far from their portrayal in the newspapers. Bonnie and Clyde were responsible for 13 murders, some of whom were innocent people, killed during one of Clyde's many bungled robberies. Bonnie and Clyde lived out of their car, stealing new cars as often as possible, and lived off the money they stole from small grocery stores and gas stations. [PAR] While Bonnie and Clyde sometimes robbed banks, they never managed to walk away with very much money. Bonnie and Clyde were desperate criminals, constantly fearing what they were sure was to come -- dying in a hail of bullets from a police ambush. [PAR] Background of Bonnie [PAR] Bonnie Parker was born on October 1, 1910 in Rowena, Texas as the second of three children to Henry and Emma Parker. The family lived somewhat comfortably off Henry Parker's job as a bricklayer, but when he died unexpectedly in 1914, Emma Parker moved the family in with her mother in the small town of Cement City, Texas (now part of Dallas). [PAR] From all accounts, Bonnie Parker was beautiful. She stood 4' 11"" and weighed a mere 90 pounds. She did well in school and loved to write poetry. ( Two poems that she wrote while on the run helped make her famous.) [PAR] Bored with her average life, Bonnie dropped out of school at age 16 and married Roy Thornton. The marriage wasn't a happy one and Roy began to spend a lot of time away from home by 1927. Two years later, Roy was caught for robbery and sentenced to five years in prison. They never divorced. [PAR] While Roy was away, Bonnie worked as a waitress; however, she was out of a job just as the Great Depression was really getting started at the end of 1929. [PAR] Background of Clyde [PAR] Clyde Barrow was born on March 24, 1909 in Telico, Texas as the sixth of eight children to Henry and Cummie Barrow. Clyde's parents were tenant farmers , often not making enough money to feed their children. During the rough times, Clyde was frequently sent to live with other relatives. [PAR] When Clyde was 12-years old, his parents gave up tenant farming and moved to West Dallas where Henry opened up a gas station.

"[DOC] [TLE] Nick FuryColonel Nicholas Joseph ""Nick"" Fury is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer/artist Jack Kirby and writer Stan Lee, Fury first appeared in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #1 (May 1963), a World War II combat series that portrayed the cigar-chomping Fury as leader of an elite U.S. Army unit. A popular character over a number of decades, in 2011, Fury was ranked 33rd in IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes,  and 32nd in their list of ""The Top 50 Avengers"".  He has sometimes been considered an antihero. [PAR] The modern-day Fury, initially a CIA agent, debuted a few months later in Fantastic Four #21 (Dec. 1963). In Strange Tales #135 (Aug. 1965), the character was transformed into a spy like James Bond and leading agent of the fictional espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The character makes frequent appearances in Marvel books as the former head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and as an intermediary between the U.S. government or the United Nations and various superheroes. It is eventually revealed that Fury takes a special medication called the Infinity Formula that halted his aging and allows him to be active despite being nearly a century old. [PAR] Nick Fury appears in several Marvel series set in alternate universes, as well as multiple animated films, television shows, and video games based on the comics. The character was first portrayed in live action by David Hasselhoff in the 1998 television movie Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Samuel L.

The actor was moved to tears as he recalled preliminary make-up tests, in which he found himself, made up as a woman, “shocked that I wasn’t more attractive”. He claims the experience led to an epiphany in which he realised that he would never approach a woman of such an appearance, based purely on her (lack of) looks. “There are too many interesting women I have not had the experience to know”, he concluded “because I have been brainwashed”. [PAR] It is a strikingly honest admission, and yet not surprising to anyone who has seen “Tootsie”, one of the most head-on confrontations that mainstream Hollywood has ever made with issues of gender roles. The film was a wild success when released, nominated for ten Oscars and grossing the equivalent of over $400 million in the US alone, second only to “E.T.” that year. Considering the type of films that are able to make that amount of money these days – and the kind of roles they typically offer their female characters – it is somewhat extraordinary to recall just how commercial a hit a film like “Tootsie” was. [PAR] “Tootsie” is, in fact, the story of a man – namely Michael Dorsey, played by Dustin Hoffman. Michael is an actor, talented yet unemployable due to his reputation for being difficult to work with. When his friend Sandy (Teri Garr) misses out on a part in a soap, he decides to audition himself, disguised in drag, and somewhat miraculously gets the part. Only his agent and his roommate – played by director Sydney Pollack and Bill Murray respectively – are in on the secret. To everyone else, ‘Dorothy Michaels’ is the sweet-hearted, plain-talking and rather dowdy woman she appears – and that’s where the fun begins. [PAR] As Michael starts work on the soap, he is immediately struck by how preposterously Dorothy’s character Emily Kimberly has been written. When an older male co-star is scripted to attempt an uninvited kiss, Dorothy responds by slapping him in the face. The crew are shocked – but the female producer is delighted, while the chauvinist male director professes himself thrilled with such feistiness. Dorothy is allowed to play the scene as she chooses, and soon her ballsy improvisations become a trademark. Time and again, Michael-as-Dorothy-as-Emily speaks up against the sexism and misogyny inherent in the scripts, not to mention the leery behaviour of the director. “Think of me as a person, not as a woman”, Dorothy demands. “You are the first female character who is her own person” the producer breathlessly confides. [PAR] Of course, there is something potentially unsavory in the fact that it takes a man to vocalise thoughts which the female crew members clearly share but do not dare express. What prevents the film from portraying Michael as the saviour of womankind is the fact that he is only this passionate and committed in his female persona. As Michael Dorsey, the man, he is in fact a bit of loser. Indeed, the film gleans most of its pathos from the fact that Dorothy is a much more appealing person than Michael is – and it is sad each time we are reminded that she is, in fact, a charade. Being cast as a woman gives Michael license to express sensitive qualities that simply do not gel with his hot-headed macho self. As Michael he is vain, tempestuous and self-obsessed, and he starts to realise it. “I think Dorothy’s smarter than I am”, he forlornly tells his roommate. “I just wish I looked prettier.

So when a goalkeeper does score, it’s such a rare treat that it’s something you want to embrace and watch over and over again. [PAR] Only five goalkeepers are in the folklore of Premier League keepers who have scored in England’s top flight. Here are the five goals from 2001-2013: [PAR] Peter Schmeichel [PAR] After having a mightily successful career at Manchester United, epitomized by the unforgettable 1999 treble, Peter Schmeichel was back in England, after a spell at Portuguese club Sporting CP, when he signed for Aston Villa. [PAR] In 2001, he befittingly became the first goalkeeper to score a goal in the English Premier League against Everton. However his record breaking feat was not enough against the Toffees, as Villa went down 3-2 at Goodison Park. [PAR] His goal, deep into injury time capped a personal milestone, further etching his name into the echelons of the English Premier League. [PAR] However, Schmeichel did leave Manchester on a sour note, having played for United’s city rivals before hanging up his boots, and even managed to muster a clean sheet against his former employees — an action that definitely left a sour taste in the mouths of many United supporters. [PAR] Brad Friedel [PAR] The game was as tense as it could get, with Blackburn trailing 2-1 against Charlton in stoppage time back in 2004. Having won a corner, as had become the norm, even the goalkeeper joined in on the last action. Nine Blackburn players flooded the opposition’s penalty area in the hope of salvaging a draw. It was an unlikely source that came to the rescue.  Brett Emerton’s corner ended up at the feet of Paul Gallagher, who sent the ball back into the crowded penalty area, and goalkeeper Brad Friedel reacted first to the ball, unleashing a vicious left-footer into the net, much to the merriment of his colleagues and fans alike. [PAR] The delighted American had surely rescued a point for his side — at least that was what he thought, only to let in an even later goal from Claus Jensen’s effort. Poor Brad was left licking his wounds, after having gone from hero to villain almost instantly. [PAR] Paul Robinson [PAR] We had all grown accustomed to the mammoth kicks by the England international. However, even with such knowledge having resided in our sub-conscious, no one was prepared for his magnificent punt back that led to a goal back in his Tottenham days. [PAR] In 2007 at White Hart Lane, Paul Robinson made a mockery of Watford with his uncalculated yet perfectly executed goal against his then English nemesis Ben Foster, who had taken away the number one jersey from him in England’s game against Spain. [PAR] Robinson launched the ball forward in a typical goalkeeper style, all the way into the opposition’s penalty area. Then, jaws dropped as the ball took an unexpectedly high bounce that deceived young Ben, bouncing over the Manchester United loaned keeper and settling innocently into the net. Wowzer! [PAR] Tim Howard [PAR] The American international, playing in a windy Merseyside encounter against Bolton in 2012, was yet another goalkeeper to have produced what seemed unthinkable — mostly due to the fact it was unintended. With the score at 0-0, what seemed like a routine clearance 92 yards away from the Bolton goal turned catastrophic for the Trotters when a gust of wind made the ball travel faster than anticipated, and was helped by an enormous bounce. The ball looped over Adam Bogdan and went into an empty net. [PAR] Howard was left bemused by the goal, as too was Bogdan —",Who was the first goalkeepers to score a goal in the Premier League?,['peter schmeichel'],173a7cd5addf413389102ce42e6bb881,"[{'end': [1025, 893], 'start': [1010, 878]}]","∃x (Goalkeeper(x) ∧ First(x, ScoreGoal, PremierLeague))"

[PAR] Electrocution as a humane means of execution was first suggested in 1881 by Dr. Albert Southwick, a dentist. Southwick had witnessed an elderly drunkard “painlessly” killed after touching the terminals of an electrical generator in Buffalo, New York. In the prevalent form of execution at the time–death by hanging–the condemned were known to hang by their broken necks for up to 30 minutes before succumbing to asphyxiation. [PAR] In 1889, New York’s Electrical Execution Law, the first of its kind in the world, went into effect, and Edwin R. Davis, the Auburn Prison electrician, was commissioned to design an electric chair. Closely resembling the modern device, Davis’ chair was fitted with two electrodes, which were composed of metal disks held together with rubber and covered with a damp sponge. The electrodes were to be applied to the criminal’s head and back. [PAR] On August 6, 1890, William Kemmler became the first person to be sent to the chair. After he was strapped in, a charge of approximately 700 volts was delivered for only 17 seconds before the current failed. Although witnesses reported smelling burnt clothing and charred flesh, Kemmler was far from dead, and a second shock was prepared. The second charge was 1,030 volts and applied for about two minutes, whereupon smoke was observed coming from the head of Kemmler, who was clearly deceased. An autopsy showed that the electrode attached to his back had burned through to the spine.

[PAR] James IV, painting by an unknown artist; in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh [PAR] Courtesy of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh [PAR] James succeeded to the throne after his father, James III , was killed in a battle against rebels on June 11, 1488. The 15-year-old monarch immediately began to take an active part in government. He extended his authority to the sparsely populated areas of western and northern Scotland and by 1493 had humbled the last lord of the Isles. [PAR] Although his reign was internally peaceful, it was disturbed by wars with England . Breaking a truce with England in 1495, James prepared an invasion in support of Perkin Warbeck , a pretender to the English throne. The war was confined to a few border forays, and a seven-year peace was negotiated in December 1497, though border raids continued. Relations between England and Scotland were further stabilized in 1503, when James married Margaret Tudor , the eldest daughter of the English king Henry VII; this match resulted, a century later, in the accession of James’s great-grandson, the Stuart monarch James VI of Scotland, to the English throne as King James I. [PAR] James IV’s growing prestige enabled him to negotiate as an equal with the rulers of continental Europe, but his position was weakened as he came into conflict with King Henry VIII of England (ruled 1509–47). In 1512 James allied with France against England and the major continental powers. When Henry invaded France in 1513, James decided, against the counsel of his advisers, to aid his ally by advancing into England. He captured four castles in northern England in August 1513, but his army was disastrously defeated at the Battle of Flodden , near Branxton, on Sept. 9, 1513. The king was killed while fighting on foot, and most of his nobles perished. James left one legitimate child, his successor, James V (ruled 1513–42); in addition, he had many illegitimate children, several of whom became prominent figures in Scotland.

He trained at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery on 18 August 1900.  [PAR] Military career [PAR] Promoted to lieutenant on 8 May 1902, Dowding served with the Royal Garrison Artillery at Gibraltar, in Ceylon and in Hong Kong before being posted to No. 7 Mountain Artillery Battery in India in 1904. After returning to the United Kingdom, he attended the Army Staff College 1912 before being promoted to captain on 18 August 1913 and being posted with the Royal Garrison Artillery on the Isle of Wight later that year. After becoming interested in aviation, Dowding gained Aviator's Certificate no. 711 on 19 December 1913 in a Vickers biplane at the Vickers School of Flying, Brooklands.  He then attended the Central Flying School, where he was awarded his wings.  Although added to the Reserve List of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), Dowding returned to the Isle of Wight to resume his Royal Garrison Artillery duties.  However, this arrangement was short-lived and in August 1914, he joined the RFC as a pilot on No. 7 Squadron. [PAR] First World War [PAR] Dowding transferred to No. 6 Squadron in October 1914 and then, after two weeks as a staff officer in France, became a Flight Commander, first with No. 9 Squadron and then with No. 6 Squadron. He became commanding officer of the Wireless Experimental Establishment at Brooklands in March 1915 and went on to be commanding officer of No. 16 Squadron in July 1915. After the Battle of the Somme, Dowding clashed with General Hugh Trenchard, the commander of the RFC, over the need to rest pilots exhausted by non-stop duty. In September 1915 the author Duncan Grinnell-Milne joined No 16 squadron as a junior pilot. Years later he published an account of his time in the squadron, in which he criticises Dowding as  being ""too reserved and aloof from his juniors"", although efficient.  Promoted to major on 30 December 1915, he was recalled to England in January 1916, and, having been promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 1 February 1916 was given command of 7 Wing at Farnborough later that month. He transferred to the command of 9 wing at Fienvillers in June 1916. Returning to England, he was promoted to temporary colonel on 1 January 1917 on appointment as commander of the Southern Group Command and promoted to temporary brigadier-general on 23 June 1917 before being given command of the southern training brigade in August 1917. He was sent to York as chief staff officer to the RAF's senior administrative officer in the area in April 1918.

Image Source: Flickr [PAR] Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin is rightly credited with being the first human to enter outer space, but he was not the first earthling to enter the vast Milky Way. [PAR] A few years before Gagarin’s groundbreaking 1961 orbit, a stray dog named Laika embarked on a suicide mission to space, becoming the first creature in history to orbit the planet. [PAR] At the time, the mutt’s successful launch was seen as one of Russian’s biggest victories. [PAR] Laika, whose name means barker in English, was picked up from the streets of Moscow a few days before the launch of Sputnik 2. Sputnik, the first artificial satellite propelled to space in history, had been sent into orbit only a month before. For this mission, the Soviets wanted to use the dog to test the safety of space travel for humans, and chose Laika because of her calm character and small size. [PAR] Picture from Soviet daily Pravda dated November 13, 1957 of Laika. Image Source: Getty Images [PAR] On November 3, 1957, Laika rocketed into orbit. The dog had only been training for a few days, which consisted of Laika being placed in progressively smaller cages as well as being placed in flight simulators. [PAR] Before Laika’s journey, the U.S. and the USSR had both sent other animals into flight for scientific studies, but only for a few minutes in sub-orbit. None had traveled into orbit. None had made it to zero-gravity. Laika would be the first. [PAR] Her groundbreaking expedition was a trip of no return, and Soviet scientists knew this from the start. They claimed her death would be humane, that the 250-pound Sputnik 2 would feed the dog and transmit its vitals signs until the oxygen ran out. Then she would be fed poisoned dog food that would kill her painlessly. [PAR] Yuri Gagarin poses with his wife Valentina and daughter Jelena on the beach in Glasma. Image Source: Getty Images [PAR] For years, people believed the Soviets’ story about the heroic dog and her humane treatment. But Laika’s ending was far from dignified and painless. At the 2002 World Space Congress in Houston, Tex., former Soviet scientist Dimitri Malashenkov revealed that the dog died within hours of launch because of stress and overheating caused by a faulty and quickly-designed temperature control system. [PAR] Indeed, Malashenkov said, the stray snatched from the streets of Moscow perished within hours. The revolutionary sphere didn’t survive, either: After five months of orbiting the planet, it returned on April 4th, 1958, burning up as it entered the atmosphere. [PAR] Though Laika died, her mission paved the way for dramatic advances in space flight. Other canine explorers would follow — 36 Soviet “sputpups,” to be exact — and provide the intelligence needed for Gagarin’s eventual mission. [PAR] Years after his historic flight, the cosmonaut pondered his connection with Laika and the other dogs who led the way into space. “I still can’t understand who I am,” Gagarin said. “The first man, or the last dog?” [PAR] Next, read about Enos , the first chimp to orbit the Earth.[DOC] [TLE] Laika the Cosmonaut Dog: USSR sends first living creature ...Laika the Cosmonaut Dog: USSR sends first living creature into orbit [PAR] Heritage Images / Getty Images Laika, Russian cosmonaut dog, in 1957.

"[DOC] [TLE] Viola (Cesario) in Twelfth Night, or What You WillViola (Cesario) in Twelfth Night, or What You Will [PAR] NEXT  [PAR] Character Analysis [PAR] Viola is Twelfth Night's gender-bending heroine. The survivor of a ship-wreck that separates her from her twin brother, Viola washes up on shore in Illyria, where she decides to cross-dress as a boy and take a job at Duke Orsino's court. As the boy servant, ""Cesario,"" Viola quickly becomes Orsino's favorite page and is given the task of wooing Olivia on Orsino's behalf. As ""Cesario,"" Viola's a little too good at her job and she finds herself in the middle of a messy love triangle when Olivia falls in love with ""Cesario,"" who can't return the Countess's favors because Viola is in love with the Duke. Got that? OK, good. [PAR] So, why does Viola cross-dress as a boy? She says she wants to disguise her identity as a way to buy some time, to figure some stuff out. But why? What's the motivation here? Well, the answer isn't quite clear. On the one hand, we could say that Viola disguises her identity because she's not capable of facing a world without her brother. This would align Viola with the likes of Olivia, who cloisters herself like a nun to mourn the death of her dead brother. On the other hand, Viola's decision to cross-dress is proactive, which makes her defiant and bold, as she willingly faces whatever comes her way. [PAR] While we're asking questions, let's talk about why Viola falls in love with Duke Orsino, because it's a bit baffling. Some critics argue that there's really no good reason for Viola to love Orsino – a guy who is self-absorbed, moody, and obnoxious. This, they argue, makes Viola just as silly as all the other characters that fall for inappropriate partners (Olivia, Malvolio, and so on). [PAR] Another answer to this question is that Viola falls for Orsino because he's passionate and poetic. (He may be a bad poet, but he's a poet nonetheless.) Whatever the reason, one thing is certain: Viola's love, unlike the passions of other characters in the play, is constant and true. Rather than hop-scotch from one romantic interest to the next (Olivia, we're talking about you), Viola's devotion is rock-steady and perhaps even a bit self-destructive. (Why else would she agree to deliver love letters from the man she loves to another woman? Come on. That's just brutal.) [PAR] Anyway, Viola's love for the Duke is the one thing that seems to pull the guy out of his self-absorbed world and into a relationship with another human being (rather than the relationship he seems to have with himself). Similarly, Viola or ""Cesario"" is also the magnetic figure that draws Olivia from her cloistered state of ""mourning"" into the land of the living. Even though Olivia doesn't wind up with ""Cesario,"" she does transfer her desire from ""Cesario"" to Sebastian. Without Viola, then, Olivia and Orsino would remain locked into their self-absorbed states. [PAR] OK, so what? We're glad you asked. Let's think about the big picture for a moment. As a comedy that works toward the consummation of heterosexual desire (check out our discussion of "" Genre ""), Twelfth Night uses Viola/""Cesario"" as the mechanism that throws the world into temporary chaos (her cross-dressing causes most of the mix-ups in the play) and then as the figure that restores order to the ""topsy-turvy"" world. [PAR] So, what is it that's so appealing about Viola/""Cesario"" anyway?

"[DOC] [TLE] Dynamite Announces ""Merciless: The Rise of Ming"" | Comic ...stumbleupon [PAR] Email [PAR] Official Press Release [PAR] The iconic legend Flash Gordon made his dynamic splash back into comics with Dynamite Entertainment with Flash Gordon – Zeitgeist!Â  Spinning off from that series is the prequel comic book series, Merciless – The Rise of Ming #1, which is written by Scott Beatty and drawn by Ron Adrian, with an incredible cover from Alex Ross and is in stores April 2012!Â  In issue #1, Prince Ming begins his rise to dominion over the entirety of Mongo! But who (or what) was Ming before he was ‘Merciless’? Find out here as the origin of one of science fiction’s preeminent villains is presented in all its diabolical details! Be sure to get Merciless – The Rise of Ming #1 in April 2012! [PAR] “In most heroic fiction, we (the readers, that is) never really question why the villains do very bad things. It’s always just assumed that evil is as evil does,” says writer Scott Beatty. “Ming is one of the great antagonists of science fiction. In many ways, he’s archetypal and the model for all intergalactic despots to follow. But he’s not just Ming. Everybody knows he’s Ming the MERCILESS. And he’s successful at being just that. Ming has a plan. For EVERYTHING. Readers of FLASH GORDON can think of MERCILESS: THE RISE OF MING as “required reading” for the series’ central conflict. It’s a primer that reveals not just who Ming the Merciless is–well before he ruled all of Mongo–but just what he did to get there… and WHY he did it.”â€¨ [PAR] “Scott [Beatty] has taken the groundwork laid by Eric [Trautmann] and Alex [Ross] in Flash Gordon and gone back in time to tell the tale of the Rise of Ming,” states Dynamite Editor Joe Rybandt. “This is the direct precursor to the story in Flash Gordon and presents the definitive origin of the universe’s most merciless dictator.”â€¨â€¨Flash Gordon is the hero of a science fiction adventure comic strip originally drawn by Alex Raymond. First published January 7, 1934, the strip was inspired by and created to compete with the already established Buck Rogers adventure strip.â€¨â€¨The original Flash Gordon comic strip follows the adventures of Flash Gordon, a handsome polo player and Yale graduate, and his companions Dale Arden and Dr. Hans Zarkov. The story begins with Earth bombarded by fiery meteors. Dr. Zarkov invents a rocket ship to locate their place of origin in outer space. Half mad, he kidnaps Flash and Dale, whose plane has crashed in the area, and the three travel to the planet Mongo, where they discover the meteors are weapons devised by Ming the Merciless, evil ruler of Mongo.â€¨â€¨For many years, the three companions have adventures on Mongo, traveling to the forest kingdom of Arboria, ruled by Prince Barin; the ice kingdom of Frigia, ruled by Queen Fria; the jungle kingdom of Tropica, ruled by Queen Desira; the undersea kingdom of the Shark Men, ruled by King Kala; and the flying city of the Hawkmen, ruled by Prince Vultan. They are joined in several early adventures by Prince Thun of the Lion Men. Eventually, Ming is overthrown, and Mongo is ruled by a council of leaders led by Barin. Flash and friends return to Earth and have some adventures before returning to Mongo and crashing in the kingdom of Tropica, before reuniting with Barin and others. Flash and his friends would travel to other worlds and frequently return to Mongo, where Prince Barin, married to Ming’s daughter Princess Aura, has established a peaceful rule (except for frequent revolts led by Ming or by one of his many descendants). The long story of the Skorpii War takes Flash to other star systems, using starships that are faster than light. [PAR] Scott Beatty has worked extensively for the popular comic book publisher DC Comics since the mid ’90s.

He is incredibly accurate with this weapon. [PAR] History: ""Part man. Part machine. All cop. The future of law enforcement."" [PAR] (Robocop movie) In the near future a cash crisis forces the government to sell off responsibility for policing to private companies. In Detroit it is multinational corporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP) that takes over the city's Police Department. Police dissatisfaction with their new bosses soon builds until a strike is threatened. OCP responds by secretly producing a prototype robotic law enforcer, ED-209, but ED proves unable to show restraint, blowing away an executive during a board room demonstration. [PAR] Officer Alex Murphy is one of the better cops in Detroit. Even as his fellow cops talk of striking, the devoted family man continues to patrol the streets alongside his partner Anne Lewis. Sadly his dedication to duty proves no defense when he encounters criminal mastermind Clarence Boddicker and his gang. Separated from his fellow officers, he is viciously maimed before being finished off with a shot to the head. His dying body was retrieved by his partner, and rushed to hospital, where he was declared dead a short while later. [PAR] This was the opportunity OCP technicians were waiting for. Since all Police officers had signed waivers when they joined the force, Murphy's body was now OCP property. ED-209 had the fire-power, but not the cop instincts. Alex Murphy had the instincts, but not the firepower. OCP planned to amalgamate the two types of law enforcer, to create the perfect cyborg cop, company property and on-duty 24 hours a day. The man he had been was dead, his memories supposedly gone, and in his place was Robocop, programmed to Serve the Public Trust, Protect the Innocent, and Uphold the Law. [PAR] The new cyber-cop was soon in action on the streets of Detroit. Criminals found that his command of ""Dead or alive, you are coming with me"" was no idle threat, backed as it was by his bullet-proof casing, deadly fire-power, pin-point accuracy and superhuman strength. He was stationed, under supervision of OCP technicians, back in his old precinct, although his fellow cops didn't know who he had once been. But problems began to arise. His memories as Alex Murphy began to revive; his old partner, Anne, recognised him through a trademark gesture (he would spin his gun before holstering it, a trick he had copied off TJ Laser, his son's favourite tv character); and when he ran across Clarence Boddicker and his men again, it became clear they were working for and protected by men high up in OCP.

"[DOC] [TLE] Airfrance Klm Merger Case - Research Paper - 2238 WordsAirfrance Klm Merger Case Essay - 2238 Words [PAR] Please sign up to read full document. [PAR] Text Preview [PAR] 1. Introduction [PAR] In 2004 Europe’s largest airline group was formed after the European Commission had approved a merger between French Air France and Dutch KLM. A merger of this dimension certainly has major influences on the economy. This paper will give an insight on the incidents of this instance, the economic consequences and it will deal with the question whether the European Commission’s decision was reasonable. [PAR] First of all the two firms will be introduced and an overview about the merger will be provided. After that some basic economic concepts will be explained, followed by a merger’s consequences on the economy. The next part will then deal with the European Commission, in particular their investigation of the situation and its resulting decision. In the very end a conclusion about the whole case will be drawn. [PAR] 2. The Merger [PAR] Air France is a Paris-based, French airline. It operates worldwide from its international main hub at Paris Charles de Gaulle International Airport and within France from its national hub at Paris Orly Airport. Furthermore, Air France is one of the founding members of the SkyTeam, which is an alliance of several airlines from all over the world. At this date SkyTeam was the third largest airline alliance in the world, following oneworld (British Airways, American Airlines, etc.) and the Star Alliance (Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, etc.). Before the merger Air France was controlled by the French government, which owned 54.5 percent of the airline’s shares. During the merging-process, however, the state reduced its share to 18.6 percent and thus privatized Air France. [PAR] The object of acquisition, KLM, is a Dutch airline with its main hub at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Its most important business units are passenger and cargo transport within Northern Europe and to the Far East (EC, 2004a). Since 1989 KLM also operates in a joint venture on transatlantic routes with Northwest Airlines, one of the United States’ largest air carriers. [PAR] The plan of Air France and KLM to merge was publicly announced for the first time in September 2003 by Jean-Cyril Spinetta, Chief Executive of Air France. The final decision to go ahead with the union resulted from a ruling by the European Union to override its member states’ individual deals with non-member states and negotiate common European agreements with all of them. “It’s time for the airline industry to accept this European Dimension,” Spinetta said, indicating that it was time for Europe’s largest cross-border airline merger in history: The combined Air France-KLM airline group turnover in 2002-2003 was about 19.17 billion euros (BBC, 2004), which makes them the world’s largest air carrier by revenue. Measured by passenger-miles, 58.8 million passengers per year would rank them right after American Airlines and United Airlines as third worldwide (Tagliabue, 2003). [PAR] In December 2003 a framework agreement, which stated that Air France will acquire control of KLM, was signed by both parties. Air France will obtain 100 percent of KLM’s shares for 140 percent of what they were traded at, at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, before. Although both companies will belong to a new holding corporation named Air France-KLM, they will continue operating independently under their individual brand names for at least three years because the deal included, that KLM will retain 51 percent of their voting power for an initial period (EC, 2004b, p.2). Additionally, the Dutch airline will also join the SkyTeam alliance. [PAR] Two firms of such immense size as Air France and KLM, though, cannot just decide to combine forces and go ahead with their plan. The process requires a detailed investigation by the European Commissions, whether the merger is consistent with its Competition Policy and only after legal approval of the EC the merger can be executed.

There have been periods where Ben could assume human form at will; however, these situations seldom last long. He also has enhanced stamina and lung capacity, and increased resistance to sensory and temperature extremes. His reflexes are above-average by human standards despite his immense mass, and he retains a reasonable level of agility and dexterity. [PAR] Abilities [PAR] Ben is an exceptionally skilled and experienced pilot, proficient with many varieties of both conventional and exotic aircraft, and was also trained as an astronaut. He is uniquely gifted in the art of hand-to-hand combat (a skill Ben honed long before he became the Thing), though his fighting style tends to be a rather loose brawling technique all his own. In his youth, Ben was a talented football player. [PAR] Weapons [PAR] None [PAR] Paraphernalia [PAR] Like the rest of the FF, Ben wears highly durable costuming composed of unstable molecules.

[PAR] 13. Civil War [PAR] Early Years On Yancy Street [PAR] Ben Grimm grew up in poverty at 7135 Yancy Street, on Manhattan's Lower East Side. His drunken father couldn't hold down a job, so much of their family's income came from Ben's older brother Dan, who led the Yancy Street Gang. Ben idolized his brother, and when Dan was killed in a gang fight, Ben grew increasingly bitter-especially after his aunt Sophie died of cancer that same year. Ben joined the Yancy Street Gang himself, eventually becoming its leader; however, when his parents were killed in an accident, the teenage Ben was forced to move uptown to live with his new guardians, his Uncle Jake and Aunt Alyce. The Yancy Street Gang denounced Ben as a sellout after he moved away, developing an enduring grudge against their former leader. A respected medical doctor, Jake had pulled himself up from the Yancy Street slums and hoped he could help Ben make something of himself as well. Jake and Alyce were tough but loving parents, and while Ben resisted them at first, their unconditional affection gradually won him over. Ben finished high school, discovering his natural football talent along the way, and won a full-ride sports scholarship to State University. [PAR] Off to College, New Friends, and Heartbreak [PAR] Ben roomed with Reed Richards , who dreamed of someday building a starship; Grimm jokingly promised that if Reed ever built it, he would fly it. Ben became a star quarterback at State, and spent much of his time trying to coax his more socially awkward roommate out of his shell.

Mr. Freeze [PAR] By JANET MASLIN [PAR] Published: June      20, 1997 [PAR] AT a gala in Gotham City, the fabulous Poison Ivy makes her entrance in a fluffy magenta gorilla suit made from 450 Santa Claus wigs. Then she peels this off slowly as the band plays her theme song. And out comes the most show-stopping character in ''Batman and Robin,'' the fourth and most frenetically gaudy feature in the series. As played by Uma Thurman, Poison Ivy is perfect, flaunting great looks, a mocking attitude and madly flamboyant disguises. Like Mae West, she mixes true femininity with the winking womanliness of a drag queen. [PAR] Poison Ivy captures the essence of ''Batman and Robin,'' a wild, campy costume party of a movie and the first ''Batman'' to suggest that somewhere in Gotham City there might be a Studio 54. Joel Schumacher, director and ringmaster, piles on the flashy showmanship and keeps the film as big, bold, noisy and mindlessly overwhelming as possible. In this context, it's not surprising that even the opening credit sequence is at fever pitch. The movie begins with Batman and Robin caught up in a crazed hockey match, taking off on a rocket and then surfing through space. [PAR] Aiming for comic book fans with a taste for heavy sarcasm and double-entendres, the lavish ''Batman and Robin'' cares only about delivering nonstop glitter. In the interests of this, it is more than happy to steamroll over questions of character and plotting. There's not much more to Batman, now played affably but blandly by George Clooney and given only second billing, than a heroic jaw line, understanding gaze and anatomically correct rubber suit. The mixed-up, melancholy Batman of Tim Burton's first two films looks like the brooding Prince of Denmark next to this. [PAR] What ''Batman and Robin'' does deliver is outlandish visual mischief, and the more the merrier. The architecture of Gotham City now incorporates huge, hunky male statuary, and the local punks suggest ''A Clockwork Orange'' and heavy metal bands. Gotham throws a Save the Rainforest costume ball, complete with extras doing a Polynesian dance number. Mr. Freeze, the lumbering villain played by Arnold Schwarzenegger plus a 45-pound suit equipped with a couple of thousand tiny blue lights, is the occasion for crazy experiments in icy decor. Since ''Batman and Robin'' does its best to throw in something for everyone, there's even a dinosaur in one of these frosty scenes. [PAR] Like ''Batman Forever,'' the new film was directed fancifully by Mr. Schumacher and written by Akiva Goldsman (one of several ''Batman'' writers last time). Like ''Batman'' characters, these two lead double lives: they also collaborated on two John Grisham adaptations, ''The Client'' and ''A Time to Kill,'' which concern real people experiencing life without benefit of special effects. In other words they're a lot smarter than, say, Mr. Freeze, whose deadliest weapon in the film is an arsenal of har-har puns. Like: ''I'm afraid my condition has left me cold to your pleas!'' And: ''You are not sending me to the cooler!'' [PAR] Mr. Schwarzenegger wears his armor manfully and delivers such lines with suitable smirks. And his Mr. Freeze is introduced as a former two-time Nobel Prize winner in molecular biology, which is surely the funniest thing in the movie.

"[DOC] [TLE] Agamemnon, King of Mycenae, the leader of Greeks in the ...Agamemnon, King of Mycenae, the leader of Greeks in the Trojan war - Greek Gods, Mythology of Ancient Greece [PAR] Agamemnon [PAR] Agamemnon [PAR] Agamemnon was a Greek leader in the great Trojan war. The war made him recognisable throughout historical and mythological recordings, even to this day. Despite his heroics and great leadership, Agamemnon was a casualty of unfortunate events in his family which were based on treachery, rape, murder and incest.  He managed to run away and take refuge in Sparta with his brother Menelaus who then became a king of Sparta and helped Agamemnon to reclaim his throne in Mycenae . When Helen of Sparta was abducted, Menelaus called upon his brother who became a leader of the Greeks in Trojan war that lasted for ten years.  Agamemnon himself managed to survive but was murdered upon his arrival back to his homeland, by either his wife Clytemnestra whom he married while at Sparta or her lover who happened to be Aegisthus, the son of his uncle Thyestes who fathered him with his own daughter Pelopia. [PAR] Appearance in the works of art [PAR] In the works of art, Agamemnon`s depiction resemble and is very similar to the representation  of Zeus , the king of the gods. Agamemnon is generally depicted wearing a diadem and holding a scepter which are among conventional attributes of kings. [PAR] Family quarrel [PAR] In his early life, there were plenty of things going wrong. His father Atreus murdered the children of his twin brother Thyestes, after finding out his adultery with his wife Aerope. Atreus even went so far that the murdered children were on the menu of Thyestes for a while. However, Atreus hadn`t murdered all of his children, mostly because he didn`t know about Aegisthus who was a son of Thyestes and Thyestes` daughter Pelopia. It was not long, before Aegisthus took revenge on Atreus and murdered him. He then claimed the throne of Mycenae and ruled hand to hand with Thyestes. Together, they exiled Agamemnon and Menelaus from Mycenae. The brothers took refuge at the place of Tyndareus, a king of Sparta, where they married the king`s daughters Helen and Clytemnestra. Agamemnon and  Clytemnestra together had four children, one son and three daughters. Eventually, Menelaus succeeded Tyndareus in Sparta and with his superior army helped his brother to drove away Thyestes and reclaim his throne in Mycenae. For a while they enjoyed a decent life, until Paris kidnapped Helen, the wife of his brother Menelaus. [PAR] Trojan war [PAR] This act, which was caused by the gods themselves, led to a war between Greeks and Trojans. And it happened to be king Agamemnon who led his people into  battle. He had to overcome his first obstacle while still in Greece. He offended Artemis by killing one of her sacred animals and the angry goddess obstructed their departure from Boeotia. Greek soldiers were becoming more and more reluctant and, as a result of this, he had to sacrifice one of his daughters, called Iphigenia, to the angry goddess. [PAR] Finally, Agamemnon made peace with Artemis, gathered his army, including two of the finest heroes Odysseus and Achilles , and set sail for Troy. Agamemnon then led his men into a battlefield, filled them with good positive morale and himself fought bravely. He killed many Trojans until he was finally wounded and  forced to withdraw to his camp. It looked like they were going to win with ease, until his act to take away Briseis from Achilles, after losing Chryseis to Apollo , corrupted their progress. Briseis was a local woman of great beauty whom Achilles took for himself, after clearing the village in the Trojan lands. It resulted for Achilles withdrawing himself from the battlefield as a revengeful act. The Greeks consequently started losing battles and morale was getting lower and lower. However, later on, as you probably already know, Achilles returned to battle when his closest friend was killed and Agamemnon finally gave up on Briseis and returned her to him. Eventually, with Achilles killing Hector and Odysseus` great disguise in the shape of a Trojan horse, the Greeks managed to capture the city of Troy and win the war.

By all accounts the Dillingers were a normal ""all-American"" family, but the normality was broken when John was three and his mother passed away (her death has been ascribed to a variety of causes, but the best guess is that she died of pneumonia). With his mother gone and his sister getting married and moving out a few years later, John was left alone with his father, who was caring but not very affectionate. In that kind of environment young John, a naturally rambunctious boy, began to rebel and get into all sorts of mischief, including shoplifting, vandalism and even stealing coal from train cars and selling it to neighbors. In order to curb his son's wild behavior, as well as to fulfill his own need for companionship, John Sr. married Elizabeth Fields and moved the family back to her hometown of Mooresville, IN, but the change of scenery did little to deter John's behavior. He was still in and out of trouble, and by the time he was 16 he had dropped out of high school and taken a job at a machine shop. Even as a young adult, though, John was irresponsible and in 1921 he was caught by a policeman in Indianpolis trying to steal a car. He managed to elude the officer in a foot pursuit, fled home and joined the Navy. He was assigned to the U.S.S. Utah (a ship that would later be sunk by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor). Unable to stay out of trouble even in the Navy, he soon deserted and returned home, and not long afterwards in 1924 he married Beryl Hovius and took another job. He was a neglectful and sometimes abusive husband and an absentee worker, and hooked up with an ex-con named Ed Singleton. They hatched a plan to mug an elderly grocer named Frank Morgan, who was known to carry his weekly cash and receipts with him to the bank after his store closed on Saturday night. The plan was for John to rob the old man at gunpoint on the street and hop into a getaway car driven by Singleton, which was parked at a nearby curb. However, when John confronted Morgan, the old man fought back, knocking the gun out of John's hand and causing it to fire. Thinking he had accidentally shot the old man (which he hadn't), John fled to the pre-arranged getaway spot, only to find that Singleton wasn't there. He fled on foot but was caught two days later. The incident aroused public indignation, and after a trial and conviction, the judge gave John 10 years for assault with a deadly weapon (he had tried pistol-whipping the old man) and 20 years for attempted robbery, despite the fact that this was John's first crime and he had pleaded guilty and confessed freely to the crime. Embittered, Dillinger vowed revenge. [PAR] He was sent to Indiana's Pendleton Reformatory, where he hooked up with experienced thieves Harry Pierpont and Homer Van Meter. There John learned a little bit about crime. In 1929 Beryl divorced him and he was denied parole. He was later transferred to the reformatory at Michigan City, where he was reunited with the recently transferred Pierpont and Van Meter and introduced to Charles Makley, Russell Clark and John ""Red"" Hamilton, all professional robbers.

Humphries is best known for writing and playing his on-stage and television alter egos Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson. He is also a film producer and script writer, a star of London's West End musical theatre, an award-winning writer and an accomplished landscape painter. For his delivery of dadaist and absurdist humour to millions, biographer Anne Pender described Humphries in 2010 as not only ""the most significant theatrical figure of our time … [but] the most significant comedian to e ... (展开) emerge since Charlie Chaplin"".  Humphries' characters have brought him international renown, and he has appeared in numerous films, stage productions and television shows. Originally conceived as a dowdy Moonee Ponds housewife who caricatured Australian suburban complacency and insularity, Edna has evolved over four decades to become a satire of stardom, the gaudily dressed, acid-tongued, egomaniacal, internationally feted Housewife Gigastar, Dame Edna Everage. Humphries' other major satirical character creation was the archetypal Australian bloke Barry McKenzie, who originated as the hero of a comic strip about Australians in London (with drawings by Nicholas Garland) which was first published in Private Eye magazine. The stories about ""Bazza"" (Humphries' nickname, an Australian term of endearment for the name Barry) gave wide circulation to Australian slang, particularly jokes about drinking and its consequences (much of which was invented by Humphries), and the character went on to feature in two Australian films, in which he was portrayed by Barry Crocker.  Humphries' other satirical characters include the ""priapic and inebriated cultural attaché"" Sir Les Patterson, who has ""continued to bring worldwide discredit upon Australian arts and culture, while contributing as much to the Australian vernacular as he has borrowed from it"", gentle, grandfatherly ""returned gentleman "" Sandy Stone, iconoclastic 1960s underground film-maker Martin Agrippa, Paddington socialist academic Neil Singleton, sleazy trade union official Lance Boyle, high-pressure art salesman Morrie O'Connor and failed tycoon Owen Steele.

[PAR] mattstone.blogs.com [PAR] Main Image:  [PAR] The Book of Kells is an illuminated manuscript of the Gospel book containing the four Gospels written in red, yellow, purple and black ink. The Book of Kells is considered as Ireland’s national treasure and the finest example of illuminated manuscript of medieval Europe. The Book of Kells was an elaborate and sacred work used during special occasions of the church when it was kept on the altar. As such it was not designed to serve any educational purpose of daily use and study. Now the Book of Kells is being reproduced in facsimile edition to make it accessible worldwide. [PAR] Content [PAR]   [PAR] What is the History of the Book of Kells? [PAR] The Book of Kells was developed on the Iona island which lies between Scotland and Ireland. But it derives its name from the Abbey of Kells, situated in the Irish Midlands, where the book was kept from the 9th century till the 16th century. The original book consisted about 350 leaves each measuring 33cm by 25 cm. The book contains the four Gospels as taken from Saint Jerome’s Latin text and also includes prefaces and summaries of the text. The original cover of the book was decorated with gold and precious jewels. The Book of Kells was shifted to the library of Trinity College, Dublin in 19661 and is easily accessible to the public. [PAR]   [PAR] How was the Book of Kells Created? [PAR] The Book of Kells was produced by Celtic monks in ca.800 A.D. The text has been taken mainly from the Vulgate with some passages drawn from the Vetus Latina which was the one of the earliest versions of the Bible. The book is regarded as the masterpiece of Western calligraphy using the unique technique of Insular illumination. The Book of Kells consists of the four Gospels in Latin text and calligraphed in a complex and elaborate script. The book is lavishly illustrated with nearly ten colors. [PAR]   [PAR] What is the Use of the Book of Kells? [PAR] The Book of Kells has a sacramental purpose when it is generally kept on the high altar in the church. The book is generally used, during Mass, for reading the Gospel. Though many a times the reader would actually be reciting the gospel from his memory rather than reading from the Book of Kells. Interestingly the Book of Kells seems to have been kept at the sacristy, a place where the articles used during Mass were kept rather than at the monastic library. The way the book was composed and retained also showed the importance given to the aesthetic value of the book over its practical use. [PAR]   [PAR] How is the Book of Kells being reproduced in Modern Times? [PAR] In order to make the Book of Kells accessible to others, the concerned officials of the Trinity College allowed for the reproduction of the book. The work was undertaken in 1986 by Urs Duggelin, a Swiss publisher who was reputed to reproduce rare illuminated manuscripts. The book was photographed with the help of a unique machine and then master craftsmen and lithographers worked to reproduce a fine facsimile ( latin word meaning “Make it the same”) of the original. The initial facsimile edition of the book costed $ 18,000 and was restricted to 1,480 copies for worldwide distribution.

And yet John Fogerty and his bandmates kept on chooglin’ straight into another banner year. [PAR] 2010 marks the 40th anniversary of the release of both Cosmo’s Factory and Pendulum, which took the band through the apex of its career with four more Top 10s: “Travelin’ Band,” “Up Around the Bend,” “Lookin’ Out My Back Door” and “Have You Ever Seen the Rain.” [PAR] As a wordsmith and melodist, Fogerty’s direct writing and composing style marks him as one of the greatest American songwriters of the rock era. But there was another factor that made Creedence Clearwater so popular — Fogerty’s swampy signature guitar sound. Thanks to his gutty style, the group was instantly recognizable from the opening notes of numbers like “Bad Moon Rising,” “Fortunate Son” and “Green River.” And Gibsons, mostly Les Pauls, were the bedrock of that sound. [PAR] When the band began in 1968 after Fogerty and drummer Doug Clifford completed stints in the military, Fogerty replaced his Rickenbacker with his first Gibson model, an ES-175 that he used to cut “Proud Mary,” “Bootleg,” “Graveyard Train” and much of the rest of 1969’s Bayou Country. After that guitar was stolen he purchased his first Les Paul, and that Gibson model has been a crucial part of his sonic arsenal ever since. [PAR] Fogerty owned two black Les Paul Customs outfitted with Bigsby vibrato arms during Creedence’s salad days, which he used in the studio and on-stage. He notably brandished one at Woodstock , joining the ranks of fellow Gibson players Carlos Santana, Leslie West, Johnny Winter, Alvin Lee and Pete Townshend ( who smashed his SG Special to bits during the Who’s set ). [PAR] In Creedence, Fogerty always used a Gibson when he played in open D (D-A-D-F#-A-D) tuning, which is the foundation of his dark, swampy sound. Try playing the barre chords to the introduction of “Proud Mary” in that tuning starting on the 10th fret, and you’ll find yourself right in the zone. “Bad Moon Rising,” “Midnight Special” and “",Which American band had hits with Bad Moon Rising and Proud Mary?,"['creedence clearwater', 'creedence', 'creedence clearwater revival']",dcab043bd90448fcb63131b05f3342f1,"[{'end': [2398, 65, 1645, 123, 195], 'start': [2379, 46, 1626, 104, 176]}, {'end': [3202, 112, 54, 1094, 3495, 1634, 2387, 184], 'start': [3194, 104, 46, 1086, 3487, 1626, 2379, 176]}, {'end': [203, 1653, 131], 'start': [176, 1626, 104]}]","∃x (AmericanBand(x) ∧ Hit(x, ""Bad Moon Rising"") ∧ Hit(x, ""Proud Mary""))"
"[DOC] [TLE] The KinksThe Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1963 by brothers Dave and Ray Davies. They are regarded as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era.   The band emerged in 1964 during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the US until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies penned ""You Really Got Me"",  became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.  Between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, the group released a string of hit singles; studio albums drew good reviews but sold less than compilations of their singles. They gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' observational writing style. Albums such as Something Else (1967), The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society (1968), Arthur (1969), Lola Versus Powerman (1970), along with their accompanying singles, are considered among the most influential recordings of the period.  [PAR] After a fallow period in the mid Seventies, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with albums Sleepwalker, Misfits, Low Budget, Give the People What They Want and State of Confusion. In addition, groups such as  Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack, the Pretenders and the Fall covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence. The Kinks broke up in 1996, a result of the commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers.  [PAR] Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run. Longest-serving member Mick Avory (drums and percussion) was replaced by Bob Henrit, formerly of Argent, in 1984. Original bassist Pete Quaife was replaced by John Dalton in 1969, and Dalton was in turn replaced by Jim Rodford in 1978. Session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band in the studio for many of their recordings in the mid-to-late 1960s. In 1969 keyboardist John Gosling joined the band, making them an official five-piece, while Ian Gibbons replaced him in 1979, playing in the band until its eventual demise. [PAR] The group had five Top 10 singles on the US Billboard chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, the group had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums.  Four of their albums have been certified gold by the RIAA. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for ""Outstanding Service to British Music"".

[PAR]  the plutonium metal, once prepared for the reactor, would be even more vulnerable to theft for making bombs than the powdered oxide. [PAR] Are fast-breeder reactors the answer to our nuclear waste nightmare? The Guardian 30 July 12 The battle is intensifying on a decision over a major fast-breeder reactor to deal with the plutonium waste at Sellafield.  Fred Pearce  “…….Britain has a history of embarrassing failures with MOX, including the closure last year of a $2 billion blending plant that spent 10 years producing a scant amount of fuel. And critics say that, even if it works properly, MOX fuel is an expensive way of generating not much energy, while leaving most of the plutonium intact, albeit in a less dangerous form. [PAR] Only fast reactors can consume the plutonium. Many think that will ultimately be the UK choice. If so, the PRISM plant would take five years to license, five years to build, and could destroy probably the world’s most dangerous stockpile of plutonium by the end of the 2020s. GEH has not publicly put a cost on building the plant, but it says it will foot the bill, with the British government only paying by results, as the plutonium is destroyed. [PAR] The idea of fast breeders as the ultimate goal of nuclear power engineering goes back to the 1950s, when experts predicted that fast-breeders would generate all Britain’s electricity by the 1970s. But the Clinton administration eventually shut down the U.S.’s research program in 1994. Britain followed soon after, shutting its Dounreay fast-breeder reactor on the north coast of Scotland in 1995. Other countries have continued with fast-breeder research programs, including France, China, Japan, India, South Korea, and Russia, which has been running a plant at Sverdlovsk for 32 years….. [PAR] Proponents of fast reactors see them as the nuclear application of one of the totems of environmentalism: recycling. But many technologists, and most environmentalists, are more skeptical. [PAR] The skeptics include Adrian Simper, the strategy director of the UK’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which will be among those organizations deciding whether to back the PRISM plan. Simper warned last November in an internal memorandum that fast reactors were “not credible” as a solution to Britain’s plutonium problem because they had “still to be demonstrated commercially” and could not be deployed within 25 years. [PAR] The technical challenges include the fact that it would require converting the plutonium powder into a metal alloy, with uranium and zirconium. This would be a large-scale industrial activity on its own that would create “a likely large amount of plutonium-contaminated salt waste,” Simper said.

"[DOC] [TLE] The Osmonds | Biography & History | AllMusicThe Osmonds | Biography & History | AllMusic [PAR] google+ [PAR] Artist Biography                             by Steve Huey [PAR] Following the breakout success of the Jackson 5 in 1970, it was practically inevitable that a pre-existing quintet of brothers, who had already enjoyed almost a decade in the national spotlight, would follow them to teen idol superstardom. With dynamic youngest brother Donny as a focal point (much like Michael was for the Jacksons ), the Osmonds did exactly that, enjoying a run of massive popularity during 1971-1972. While their success as a unit began to wane and had flickered out by the end of 1974, the Osmonds spun off a long-lasting show business career for Donny (as well as sister Marie ), and the other members of the group even enjoyed a successful comeback as country artists. [PAR] Born to George and Olive Osmond of Ogden, UT, brothers Alan (born June 22, 1949), Wayne (born August 28, 1951), Merrill (born April 30, 1953), and Jay (born March 2, 1955) began singing together in 1959, honing their performance skills at family entertainment venues such as county fairs and amusement parks. At this point, the brothers chiefly sang barbershop harmony, mixing some gospel tunes into their repertoire as well. In 1962, George took the boys to Los Angeles, hoping to secure an audition for The Lawrence Welk Show; after Welk refused to see the group, their father eased the disappointment with a trip to Disneyland, where the brothers gave an impromptu concert with another barbershop quartet employed by the park. The Osmonds were signed on as regular nighttime performers, and luck smiled on them just a few weeks later when the father of popular singer -- and newly minted variety show host -- Andy Williams caught their act and recommended them to his son. Five days before Christmas in 1962, the Osmonds made their national television debut on The Andy Williams Show, on which they would continue to appear regularly until its cancellation in 1967. About a year after that initial appearance, younger brother Donny (born December 9, 1957) officially joined the group as well, and the Osmonds soon began to broaden their musical range with clean-cut pop songs. [PAR] Following the demise of the Williams series, the Osmonds moved on to The Jerry Lewis Show, where they stayed until 1969. In 1970, the commercial explosion of family bubblegum groups such as the real-life Jackson 5 and the fictional Partridge Family made the Osmonds obvious candidates for pop stardom. MGM president Mike Curb signed the Osmonds and sent them to work with Muscle Shoals studio owner and famed R&B producer Rick Hall . Hall 's staff songwriter George Jackson had penned a sure-fire hit titled ""One Bad Apple (Don't Spoil the Whole Bunch),"" which appeared on the group's debut album, Osmonds . Released as a single at the very beginning of 1971, ""One Bad Apple"" shot up the charts and landed in the top spot for five weeks, finally establishing the Osmonds as recording stars after nearly a decade in the public eye. A steady stream of hits continued unabated through 1972, including ""Double Lovin',"" the Top Five hits ""Yo-Yo"" and ""Down by the Lazy River,"" ""Hold Her Tight,"" and ""Crazy Horses."" Their albums sold well too; Osmonds went gold, as did its four followers: 1971's Homemade and the 1972 triumvirate of Phase-III , The Osmonds Live , and Crazy Horses . What's more, Donny 's concurrent solo career was in full swing as well, with ""Go Away Little Girl"" topping the singles charts in 1971. [PAR] The Osmonds' momentum was slowed a bit in 1973 with The Plan , a concept album about their Mormon faith that failed to connect with the record-buying public to the same degree (although it was surprisingly popular in the U.K.).

[PAR] Belloq became Indiana's foe at graduate school, when he plagiarized his essay on stratigraphy, thus winning an award that rightfully belonged to Indiana. Another encounter in 1934 is detailed, when Indiana spends months preparing a dig in Rub' al Khali, only to arrive and discover Belloq has excavated the region. [PAR] Biography [PAR] Early life [PAR] René Emile Belloq was born in Marseilles, France to a wealthy wine making family at Forteresse Malevil, and claimed to be a relative of Jean Lafitte. He had at least one sibling, a brother named Claude Belloq . Belloq grew up admiring France's most acclaimed archaeologists and made it his mission to become one himself by enrolling at the Sorbonne where a fellow student named Indiana Jones was studying linguistics. [PAR] In August 1922, the two met at an archaeological dig at Ur in Iraq where Belloq absconded with several artifacts and sold them off, damaging the reputation of Doctor Andrés Uribe in the process. However, the act made Belloq a contact with dealers on the black market. Returning to the university, Belloq came across a paper on stratigraphy by Jones and plagiarized the work. As a result, he was awarded the Archaeological Society Prize with Jones unable to prove the theft. [PAR] His accolade and inherited wealth bought him a job at the Louvre in Paris as an assistant curator. He held the position for under a year as he became suspect in the funding of a grave robbing expedition in Persia which led to the deaths of several of the museum's employees and a British archaeologist. Fired, Belloq became a mercenary to whomever could afford him. [PAR] At some point in his career, Belloq journeyed to Estray in the Orkney Islands where the ruins were believed to hold the lost treasure of tenth century Viking pirate Magnus Redhand. Belloq's methods only resulted in angering the locals, and he left them distrustful of all archaeologists. Belloq also traveled to Peru where he made contact with the indigenous Hovitos tribe while searching for the Temple of the Chachapoyan Warriors. However, he was unable to convince the Hovitos to take him to the sacred valley of their Chachapoyan ancestors where the temple was located. [PAR] His career also saw the Louvre officially hire Belloq to search for the Star Map of Baghdad in French-controlled Syria. While Belloq was in the country with French government's permission, Jones was suspicious, and asked people to keep an eye on his rival. [PAR] Price hunter [PAR] In 1930, Belloq was on the trail of the Uppsala Scroll and traveled to Sweden to acquire it for the Nazis. Unfortunately, he reached the site too late, only finding Theresa Lawrence, who did not have the scroll, but instead possessed Baldur's Ring. He went to London, and with the help of some thugs, he stole the scroll from Marcus Brody. He traveled to Marrakesh where he met with his buyer, Krause. While showing the potency of the scroll's information, Belloq was unaware of Jones disguised nearby. When Jones stole the scroll and escaped, Belloq and Krause made the Nazi soldiers follow him. In a dead-end alley, Belloq found Jones fighting with a Nazi, and recovered the scroll. Giving the scroll to Krause, he offered to enlist Jones in future operations for the Nazis. Krause revealed that the scroll was a Torah, and Belloq was enraged at his deal gone sour - Jones had given the real scroll to Lawrence during the chase. With no deal, Belloq tried to maintain face with Krause and left Jones beat-up in the alley. [PAR] In 1931, Belloq sought the Invincible Ruby of Ali Bey, and his research team recognized the need to obtain the five mammalian Wohat Statues. Belloq hired Ali Bey-Faisal to steal them from various museums around the world.

There they fend off an attack by Norman’s mother, who, dressed as the long-deceased Mrs. Bates, in reality is Norman. A psychiatrist later determines that Norman suffers from a split personality that led him to commit murder. [PAR] In 1960, the same year that director Michael Powell ’s career was nearly ruined for releasing the sexually oriented murder film Peeping Tom , Hitchcock found his greatest success with this equally disturbing film along similarly shocking plotlines. Hitchcock made Psycho on a limited budget by shooting in black and white and using the crew from his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The director financed much of the film himself in return for a large percentage of the profits, which earned him millions. The murder in the shower, one of the most famous scenes in cinematic history, was a textbook example of brilliant film editing, but the scene is probably best remembered for Bernard Herrmann ’s masterful score, in which violins , cellos , and violas screech in unison with each slash of Norman’s knife.

"[DOC] [TLE] OPEC : Brief HistoryOPEC : Brief History [PAR] Brief History [PAR] Home About Us Brief History [PAR] Brief History [PAR] The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is a permanent, intergovernmental Organization, created at the Baghdad Conference on September 10–14, 1960, by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The five Founding Members were later joined by nine other Members: Qatar (1961); Indonesia (1962) – suspended its membership in January 2009, reactivated it in January 2016, but decided to suspend it again in November 2016; Libya (1962); United Arab Emirates (1967); Algeria (1969); Nigeria (1971); Ecuador (1973) – suspended its membership in December 1992, but reactivated it in October 2007; Angola (2007); and Gabon (1975) - terminated its membership in January 1995 but rejoined in July 2016. OPEC had its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, in the first five years of its existence. This was moved to Vienna, Austria, on September 1, 1965. [PAR] OPEC's objective is to co-ordinate and unify petroleum policies among Member Countries, in order to secure fair and stable prices for petroleum producers; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on capital to those investing in the industry. [PAR] The 1960s [PAR] OPEC’s formation by five oil-producing developing countries in Baghdad in September 1960 occurred at a time of transition in the international economic and political landscape, with extensive decolonisation and the birth of many new independent states in the developing world. The international oil market was dominated by the “Seven Sisters” multinational companies and was largely separate from that of the former Soviet Union (FSU) and other centrally planned economies (CPEs). OPEC developed its collective vision, set up its objectives and established its Secretariat, first in Geneva and then, in 1965, in Vienna. It adopted a ‘Declaratory Statement of Petroleum Policy in Member Countries’ in 1968, which emphasised the inalienable right of all countries to exercise permanent sovereignty over their natural resources in the interest of their national development. Membership grew to ten by 1969. [PAR] The 1970s [PAR] OPEC rose to international prominence during this decade, as its Member Countries took control of their domestic petroleum industries and acquired a major say in the pricing of crude oil on world markets. On two occasions, oil prices rose steeply in a volatile market, triggered by the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and the outbreak of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. OPEC broadened its mandate with the first Summit of Heads of State and Government in Algiers in 1975, which addressed the plight of the poorer nations and called for a new era of cooperation in international relations, in the interests of world economic development and stability. This led to the establishment of the OPEC Fund for International Development in 1976. Member Countries embarked on ambitious socio-economic development schemes. Membership grew to 13 by 1975. [PAR] The 1980s [PAR] After reaching record levels early in the decade, prices began to weaken, before crashing in 1986, responding to a big oil glut and consumer shift away from this hydrocarbon. OPEC’s share of the smaller oil market fell heavily and its total petroleum revenue dropped below a third of earlier peaks, causing severe economic hardship for many Member Countries. Prices rallied in the final part of the decade, but to around half the levels of the early part, and OPEC’s share of newly growing world output began to recover. This was supported by OPEC introducing a group production ceiling divided among Member Countries and a Reference Basket for pricing, as well as significant progress with OPEC/non-OPEC dialogue and cooperation, seen as essential for market stability and reasonable prices. Environmental issues emerged on the international energy agenda. [PAR] The 1990s [PAR] Prices moved less dramatically than in the 1970s and 1980s, and timely OPEC action reduced the market impact of Middle East hostilities in 1990–91. But excessive volatility and general price weakness dominated the decade, and the South-East Asian economic downturn and mild Northern Hemisphere winter of 1998–99 saw prices back at 1986 levels.

In the end, when Fudge was forced to accept that Voldemort had indeed returned, the entire wizarding community called for his resignation and, after a fortnight of futile attempts to remain in office, in July 1996 he was replaced by Rufus Scrimgeour . [PAR] Scrimgeour's term ran for one year, in which he was little better than Fudge, despite his aura of experience and pro-activity; he created cover-ups and detained incorrect suspects to make it look as though he was accomplishing something. Making the same mistakes as his predecessor, he gave little chance to build up any effective defence as a whole, and it eventually cost him his life when he was overwhelmed and killed in August of 1997 , with the official line saying that he had resigned. He was replaced by Voldemort 's puppet, Pius Thicknesse . [PAR] Thicknesse, under Yaxley 's Imperius Curse , was appointed as Minister, though he was really only Voldemort's puppet, with the Dark Lord effectively becoming the true Minister. While Thicknesse was to handle everyday business, which included changing the entire Ministry to suit the Death Eaters' ideology, Voldemort was free to extend his reign beyond the government.

[PAR] Equinoxes and solstices happen twice a year. [PAR] Equinoxes and Solstices are opposite on either side of the equator. (Ill. not to scale) [PAR] Not Entirely Equal Day & Night [PAR] On the equinoxes the Sun shines directly on the equator and the length of day and night is nearly equal – but not quite. [PAR] The March equinox marks the moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator – the imaginary line in the sky above the Earth’s equator – from south to north and vice versa in September.[DOC] [TLE] Vernal (Spring) Equinox - InfopleaseVernal (Spring) Equinox [PAR] Equinox [PAR] March 20, 2016, is a date that most of us recognize as symbolic of changing seasons. As we welcome spring, people south of the equator are actually gearing up for the cooler temperatures of autumn. [PAR] What Happens at the Equinox? [PAR] Far from being an arbitrary indicator of the changing seasons, March 20 (March 21 in some years) is significant for astronomical reasons. On March 20, 2016, at precisely 12:30 [PAR] A.M. [PAR] EDT, the Sun will cross directly over the Earth's equator. This moment is known as the vernal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere. For the Southern Hemisphere, this is the moment of the autumnal equinox. [PAR] Equinox Means ""Equal Night"" [PAR] Translated literally, equinox means ""equal night."" Because the Sun is positioned above the equator, day and night are about equal in length all over the world during the equinoxes. A second equinox occurs each year on Sept. 22 or 23; in 2016, it will be on Sept. 22 at 10:21 A.M [PAR] . [PAR] EDT. This date will mark the autumnal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere and the vernal equinox in the Southern  (vernal denotes ""spring""). [PAR] Reasons for the Seasons [PAR] These brief but monumental moments owe their significance to the 23.4 degree tilt of the Earth's axis. Because of the tilt, we receive the Sun's rays most directly in the summer. In the winter, when we are tilted away from the Sun, the rays pass through the atmosphere at a greater slant, bringing lower temperatures. If the Earth rotated on an axis perpendicular to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, there would be no variation in day lengths or temperatures throughout the year, and we would not have seasons. [PAR] Rituals and Traditions [PAR] Modern astronomy aside, people have recognized the vernal equinox for thousands of years. There is no shortage of rituals and traditions surrounding the coming of spring. Many early peoples celebrated for the basic reason that their food supplies would soon be restored. The date is significant in Christianity because Easter always falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox. It is also probably no coincidence that early Egyptians built the Great Sphinx so that it points directly toward the rising Sun on the day of the vernal equinox. [PAR] The first day of spring also marks the beginning of Nowruz , the Persian New Year. The celebration lasts 13 days and is rooted in the 3,000-year-old tradition of Zorastrianism .

"[DOC] [TLE] Fatal Attraction — Out of the FOGFatal Attraction — Out of the FOG [PAR] / Ed Harrigan [PAR] Fatal Attraction is a 1987 Movie Thriller starring Glenn Close & Michael Douglas about Dan Gallagher, a New York Lawyer (played by Michael Douglas) who is stalked by Alex Forrest (played by Glenn Close) with whom he has had an affair. The story portrays Alex's increasingly unstable behavior as a result of having Borderline Personality Disorder and feeling abandoned by Dan. [PAR] When Dan tries to end the affair with Alex, she attempts suicide, stalks him and his family, vandalizes his his car, abducts one of his children and even kills the family pet. [PAR] The original script for ""Fatal Attraction"" portrayed Alex committing suicide, which would have been far more consistent with Alex's BPD character, but after screen testing the original ending, the producers gave in to commercial pressure to change the conclusion of the movie to a more crowd-pleasing ""hollywood shoot-out"" kind of ending. [PAR] Nevertheless, ""Fatal Attraction"" provided one of the most striking and convincing portrayals of a person with borderline personality disorder - including Fear of Abandonment ,  Stalking , Child Abduction, Destruction of Property and Suicidal Ideation. [PAR] Bunny Boiling is a reference to an iconic scene in the movie ""Fatal Attraction"" in which the main character Alex, who suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder, kills the family's pet rabbit and boils it on the stove. Bunny Boiling has become a popular reference to how people sometimes exhibit their rage by behaving destructively towards symbolic, important or treasured possessions or representations of those whom they wish to hurt, control or intimidate.

If you haven't experienced the joy of Casablanca, you probably haven't seen from where ""Here's looking at you, kid"" originally came. Ever heard someone make jokes about quarter pounders with cheese in France? That's Pulp Fiction, ladies and gentlemen. Ever have anyone make you an ""offer you can't refure?"" Well, that person's seen The Godfather. Ever had a former one-night stand try to inflict long-running physical and psychological pain on you and your family? Err...probably not, but if you haven't seen 1987's Fatal Attraction, you're missing out on one of the biggest pop-culture phenomenons of recent decades. [PAR] Because of Swimfan and other subpar (but, in Swimfan's case, guiltily entertaining) efforts of tribute and homage, the plot of Fatal Attraction (and maybe even its ending) is obvious before the movie even starts. Adrian Lyne's (last year's magnificent Unfaithful) film is about Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas), a New York lawyer with an attractive wife (Anne Archer) and little girl who takes a walk on the wild side one weekend and has a passionate liason with an originally casual acquaintance, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close). Dan wants it all to be over right afterwards, but Alex doesn't let him cut it off that quickly. Dan begins being harrassed by Alex in mounting forms of revenge that eventually reach his family - and become deadly (cheesy writing, huh?). Alex's continual acts of vengeance aren't easy to fight back against, though, for Dan must try to keep his secret from his wife and deal with the moral and legal implications that become increasingly complicated.

This soon drives him to hiring new agents in each episode. [PAR] Personality [PAR] Claw is evil, menacing, dark, sinister, sadistic, and a threat to all of Metro City. He is a criminal mastermind and will stop at nothing to destroy Lt. Gadget and take over the world. Most of his plots are terrorism and global attacks. Even though he is an evil mastermind, he thinks Gadget's stupidity is an act to mock him and views him as his worst enemy, and has no idea that Penny and Brain did all the work. As revealed in the  first live-action film , he lost his left hand in a accident, giving him a mechanical claw. In Gadget and the Gadgetinis , it is shown that he has had his claw since he was a baby, so he probably lost his arm when he was young or he was born without his right arm.  [PAR] He is usually at a computer terminal where he monitors his various schemes, often in a creepy old castle. Although he's aware of  Gadget 's idiocy, he believes the Inspector to be his greatest enemy, never realizing that it is actually  Penny  and  Brain  who foil his plots in each episode (although he or his  M.A.D. agents  have captured Penny and sometimes Brain a number of times). He is usually seen with his fat pet cat  M.A.D. Cat , who reaps the benefits of his brief victories and bears the brunt of his defeats. Claw's catchphrase at the end of every episode is, ""I'll get you next time, Gadget! NEXT TIME!!!"". [PAR] In the 2015 CGI series, he isn't as malicious, or as cruel or as evil as he used to be, and seems almost as incompetent as Gadget, even though he stil retains a certain evilness and cruelty that characterizes him. He is presumably either out of practice or losing his touch. [PAR] Claw's Face [PAR] Throughout the entire series, Claw is an unseen character, only just his arms and gloved hands are visible, leaving the viewer to guess as to his face and body, though a shadow of his body can be seen in  Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas .Though his face is never shown, evidence suggests that he has the appearance of a mad scientist. Despite sitting down in an executive chair for most of the series , it is clear that he possesses an intimidating physical stature (as others are usually shown cowering when he stands). [PAR] There were only 5 instances where his face was visible: [PAR] In the first live-action film (it was partially hidden in the sequel). [PAR] In the SNES game where he is fought as the final boss. [PAR] In the Gadget and the Gadgetinis episode "" The Weather Machine ,"" the viewers get to see a closeup of his face while he wakes up from his nap.

Despite the name, no actual ministers are mentioned in the book, and all public attention is focused on the idealized figurehead Big Brother. [PAR] Ministry of Love [PAR] The Ministry of Love (or Miniluv in Newspeak) serves as Oceania's interior ministry. It enforces loyalty to Big Brother through fear, buttressed through a massive apparatus of security and repression, as well as systematic brainwashing. The Ministry of Love building has no windows and is surrounded by barbed wire entanglements, steel doors, hidden machine-gun nests, and guards armed with ""jointed truncheons"". Referred to as ""the place where there is no darkness"", its interior lights are never turned off. It is arguably the most powerful ministry, controlling the will of the population. The Thought Police are a part of Miniluv. [PAR] The Ministry of Love, like the other ministries, is a misnomer, since it is largely responsible for the practice and infliction of misery, fear, suffering and torture. In a sense, however, the name is apt, since its ultimate purpose is to instill love of Big Brother—the only form of love permitted in Oceania—in the minds of thoughtcriminals as part of the process of reverting them to orthodox thought. This is typical of the language of Newspeak, in which words and names frequently contain both an idea and its opposite; the orthodox party member is nonetheless able to resolve these contradictions through the disciplined use of doublethink. [PAR] Room 101 [PAR] Room 101, introduced in the climax of the novel, is a torture chamber in the Ministry of Love, in which the Party attempts to subject a prisoner to his or her own worst nightmare, fear or phobia, with the object of breaking down their resistance. [PAR] Such is the purported omniscience of the state in the society of Nineteen Eighty-Four that even a citizen's nightmares are known to the Party. The nightmare, and therefore the threatened punishment, of the protagonist Winston Smith is to be attacked by rats. This is manifested in Room 101 by confronting Smith with a wire cage that contains two large rats. The front of the cage is shaped so that it can fit over a person's face. A trap-door is then opened, allowing the rats to devour the victim's face. This cage is fitted over Smith's face, but he saves himself by begging the authorities to let his lover, Julia, suffer this torture instead of him. The threatened torture, and what Winston does to escape it, breaks his last promise to himself and to Julia: never to betray her. The book suggests that Julia is likewise subjected to her own worst fear (although it is not revealed what that fear is), and when she and Winston later meet in a park, he notices a scar on her forehead. The intent of threatening Winston with the rats was to force him into betraying the only person he loved and therefore to break his spirit. [PAR] Orwell named Room 101 after a conference room at Broadcasting House where he used to sit through tedious meetings.Meyers, Jeffery. Orwell: Wintry Conscience of a Generation. W.W.Norton. 2000. ISBN 0-393-32263-7, p. 214. When the original room 101 at the BBC was due to be demolished, a plaster cast of it was made by artist Rachel Whiteread and displayed in the cast courts of the Victoria and Albert Museum from November 2003 until June 2004.   [PAR] Ministry of Peace [PAR] The Ministry of Peace (Newspeak: Minipax) serves as the defense ministry of Oceania's government, and is in charge of the armed forces, mostly the navy and army. The Ministry of Peace may be the most vital organ of Oceania, seeing as the nation is supposedly at war continuously with either Eurasia or Eastasia and requires just the right force to not win the war, but keep it in a state of equipoise.

"[DOC] [TLE] Harold Sakata - James Bond ActorsHarold Sakata - James Bond Actors [PAR] Liver Cancer [PAR] Summary [PAR] Harold Sakata was an actor and weightlifter most famous for his stunning performance as Oddjob in the James Bond film Goldfinger (1964). [PAR] Biography [PAR] Harold Sakata was born in Hawaii as Toshiyuki Sakata, changing his name to  Harold when he moved to a more central part of America. In his late teens,  Harold was lean and somewhat underweight, so he started lifting weights to  build himself up. He became a professional weightlifter, and at the age of 28  won a silver medal for the United States in the Summer Olympics Light-Heavyweight  event, lifting an astounding 380 pounds. His weightlifting background led him  into professional wrestling where he became a champion in several competitions  under the name Tosh Togo. [PAR] Prior to playing Oddjob in the 1964 James Bond movie Goldfinger,  Harold had absolutely no acting experience. But his strong build and muscular  appearance won him the non speaking role of Oddjob, Goldfinger's personal  bodyguard. After this legendary performance, Harold starred in many other  films, sometimes playing characters similar to Oddjob. [PAR] Milton Reid, a professional wrestler who had played Dr. No's bodyguard in  the first James Bond film Dr. No , had initially  challenged Sakata to a wrestling match, with the idea that the winner would  play Oddjob. The producers however, didn't want to reuse actors, so they chose  Harold without the match ever taking place.

He was born Toshiyuki Sakata in Hawaii, of Japanese descent. From a young age he was a proficient sportsman who developed a keen interest in wrestling, and won a Silver Medal in weightlifting for the light heavyweight division of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Sakata then went on to become a professional wrestler, and appeared under the name ""Tosh Togo"" where he became a ""bad guy"" wrestler who allegedly threw salt in his opponent's eyes. [PAR] Although he had no acting background, Sakata came to the attention of Bond producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli when they were casting for the key role of the mute Asian villain ""Odd Job"". Sakata's steely gaze and powerful physique made him perfect for the role as Auric Goldfinger's ( Gert Fröbe ) deadly bodyguard, and the fight sequence between Sean Connery and Sakata in a glittering, gold-filled Fort Knox remains one of the highlights of the Bond series. [PAR] Unfortunately, Sakata never broke free of the ""Odd Job"" stereotype, and his remaining film appearances saw him cast as military figures, muscle-bound brutes or further mute bodyguards.

"[DOC] [TLE] Psycho (1960 film)Psycho is a 1960 American psychological horror thriller directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock, and written by Joseph Stefano, starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, John Gavin, Vera Miles and Martin Balsam, and was based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The film centers on the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane (Leigh), who ends up at a secluded motel after stealing money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner-manager, Norman Bates (Perkins), and its aftermath.   [PAR] When originally made, the film was seen as a departure from Hitchcock's previous film North by Northwest, having been filmed on a low budget, with a television crew and in black and white. Psycho initially received mixed reviews, but outstanding box office returns prompted reconsideration which led to overwhelming critical acclaim and four Academy Award nominations, including Best Supporting Actress for Leigh and Best Director for Hitchcock. Psycho is now considered one of Hitchcock's best films  and praised as a work of cinematic art by international film critics and film scholars. Ranked among the greatest films of all time, it set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films,  and is widely considered to be the earliest example of the slasher film genre.  [PAR] After Hitchcock's death in 1980, Universal Studios began producing follow-ups: three sequels, a remake, a television film spin-off, and a TV series. In 1992, the US Library of Congress deemed the film ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. [PAR] Plot [PAR] During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a real estate secretary named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank, and she asks if she can take the rest of the afternoon off. Returning home, she begins to pack for an unplanned trip, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. He is suspicious about her nervous behavior but allows her to drive on. Shaken by the encounter, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags. Her transaction is all for naught—the highway patrolman sees her at the car dealership and witnesses her purchase of the newer car. [PAR] Driving on, Marion encounters a sudden rainstorm and decides to stop for the night at the Bates Motel; the proprietor, Norman Bates, invites her to a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts, but then hears an argument between Norman and his mother about bringing a woman into her house. They eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his hobby of taxidermy and his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life outside of her. Returning to her room, Marion decides to go back to Phoenix to return the stolen money. She prepares to take a shower, unaware that Norman is spying on her. As she is showering, a female figure suddenly appears and stabs her to death with a chef knife. Norman discovers the murder and meticulously cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions—including the embezzled money—into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.

A blank tile has no value in and of itself when playing Scrabble, but blank letter tiles give you flexibility in the type of words you can place on the board. For that reason, blank tiles are highly coveted in Scrabble, though rare (2 blanks per game). [PAR] Blank Tiles Equal Any Letter in the Alphabet [PAR] Remember that a blank tile can represent any letter in the English alphabet. Once played, though the blank tile is essentially like whatever letter it was originally played as. So if someone plays the blank as the “Z” in “Q-U-A-R-T-Z”, then if you play off quartz, you’ll need to build off the blank tile as if it was any other “z” on the board. Remember this tile is still worth no point value. [PAR] Play All 7 Letter Tiles [PAR] When playing the blank letter tiles, try to think of all the various possibilities for building longer words. If you the blank tile is what you need to fill out a 7 or 8 letter word, then by all means take the opportunity to get rid of all your letter tiles at once. Remember, if you play all 7 letter tiles off your letter rack at once, you gain an extra +50 point bonus. So it’s worth putting your letter tiles in an order and see if you only need one letter to complete a word. [PAR] Add an S to a Big Word [PAR] One of the big cop-outs in Scrabble is to add an “S” to a word that’s already on the board. This works for longer words and words with a lot of high point value letters. Remember that the blank tile has no point value, while building off a word that has already been played over a double and triple modifier space does not give the 2x and 3x point values. [PAR] Still, if the S gives you a nice total towards the end of the game, this might still be your best option. And if your blank tile is played onto a double word or triple word score, you get the benefit of the modifier, despite the fact that the blank tile is worth no points itself. [PAR] Using a Blank To Replace Low Value Letters [PAR] Since you don’t get the point value of the letter the blank tile represents, it’s just as good to play a blank as a 1-point letter as a 10-point letter. In fact, if you have several big point letters on your letter rack, consider using the blank as a common letter, in order to facilitate getting those big point tiles on the Scrabble board. [PAR] Using the Blank Tile for High Scrabble Scores [PAR] Studying how to use a blank tile in Scrabble can increase you Scrabble scores, since you maximize the opportunity given to you when you drew the blank tile. Try not to waste the blank on just any word, since the possibilities are so great. Pray you get two blank scores, since this should give you every opportunity of playing all seven letter tiles at once.[DOC] [TLE] The Official Rules of Scrabble - How to Play Scrabble ...The Official Rules of Scrabble - How to Play Scrabble - Learn Scrabble Rules [PAR] How to Play Scrabble [PAR] Travel Scrabble [PAR] Scrabble Rules - Scrabble Official Rules [PAR] When playing Scrabble, anywhere from two to four players will enjoy the game.

He graduated 17th of  a class of 59 from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, in time to fight in the Mexican War (1846-48). [PAR] Jackson began his United States Army career as a Second Lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment. He served at the Siege of Veracruz and the battles of Contreras,Chapultece , and Mexico City, eventually earning two brevet promotions, and the regular Army rank of First Lieutenant. It was in Mexico that Thomas Jackson first met Robert E. Lee. [PAR] In the spring of 1851, Jackson accepted a newly created teaching position at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), in Lexington Virginia. He became Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Instructor of Artillery. Parts of Jackson’s curriculum are still taught at VMI, regarded as timeless military essentials: discipline, mobility, assessing the enemy’s strength and intentions while attempting to conceal your own, and the efficiency of artillery combined with an infantry assault. [PAR] After his home state of Virginia seceded from the Union in 1861, Jackson joined the Confederate army and quickly forged his reputation for fearlessness and tenacity during the Shenandoah Valley Campaign. [PAR] Jackson served only briefly as a colonel before receiving a promotion to brigadier general under General Joseph E. Johnston. Jackson earned his nickname at the First Battle of Bull Run (also known as Manassas) in July 1861 when he rushed his troops forward to close a gap in the line against a determined Union attack. Upon observing Jackson, one of his fellow generals reportedly said, “Look, men, there is Jackson standing like a stone wall!”–a comment that spawned Jackson’s nickname. Jackson was commissioned a major general in October 1861. [PAR] By October 1862, Jackson was a lieutenant general and led a significant portion of Lee’s army. His widely publicized exploits had elevated him to legendary status among Southern soldiers and citizens alike. Jackson’s bravery and success inspired devotion from his soldiers, but to his officers, he was known as overly secretive and difficult to please. He frequently punished his officers for relatively minor violations of military discipline and rarely discussed his plans with them. Rather, they were expected to obey his orders without question. [PAR] Lee and Jackson’s most famous victory took place at the Battle of Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863. Facing a numerically superior Union force of 130,000 men to 60,000 of their own, Lee and Jackson devised and executed a plan to rout the army of Union General Joseph Hooker. [PAR] Historians call this battle one of Lee’s finest moments as a Confederate general, and his success owed much to Jackson’s participation. On May 2, Jackson stealthily and quickly took 28,000 troops on an approximately 15-mile forced march (Jackson’s Flank March) to Hooker’s exposed flank while Lee engaged in diversionary attacks on his front. Jackson’s attack on the Union right inflicted massive casualties on the superior force, and Hooker was forced to withdraw only days later. [PAR] But the victory was not without cost. Jackson’s brutal attack ended at sunset, when he took some men into the Wilderness to scout ahead. Troops from the 18th North Carolina regiment mistook them for enemy cavalry and opened fire, shooting Jackson 3 times, twice in the left arm and once in the right hand. Several of his Staff were killed, in addition to many horses. Darkness and confusion prevented Jackson from getting immediate care. He was dropped from the stretcher several times while being evacuated.  He was taken from the field and General J. E. B. Stuart took over his command.  Dr. Hunter McGuire determined that a bullet had shattered the bone just below his left shoulder, and quickly amputated Jackson’s left arm he was then moved to Thomas Chandlers Plantation.

[PAR] Lucy Kate Jackson (also known as Catherine Elise Jackson) was born in Birmingham, Alabama on October 29, 1948 to Ruth (nee Shepherd), a homemaker, and Hogan Jackson, a wholesaler of building material.  She has a younger sister named Jenny Jackson.  In 1968, Kate left home to study at the prestigious American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.  Her big break came when she was cast as a Daphne Harridge, a silent ""ghost"" in the popular gothic daytime drama Dark Shadows.   [PAR] Kate as Daphne in Dark Shadows [PAR] Kate then moved to Hollywood where she began to establish a name for herself.

She served as Prime Minister of Ceylon and Sri Lanka three times, serving from 1960-65, 1970-77 and again from 1994-2000. [PAR] first female prime minister in the world [PAR] A Brief Biography of Sirimavo Bandaranaike [PAR] The world's first female prime minister [PAR] Sirimavo Bandaranaike was born on April 17, 1916 to a prominent family. She was the eldest child in the family of six children, and had four brothers and one sister. She was educated at St Bridget's Convent in Colombo, but was a practicing Buddhist. In 1940, she got married to Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike, a member of the State council and son of a prominent advisor to the Governor. [PAR] Her husband Solomon, was a founding member of the United National Party (UNP) in 1946 and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1947 before breaking away from the UNP and forming the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Solomon became Prime Minister after the SLFP won a majority in the House of Representatives in the 1956 general elections. Three years later, he was assassinated. [PAR] Sirimavo then stepped into politics. In 1960, when a member of the Semate stepped down from his seat, Sirimavo was appointed as a member of the Senate from the SLFP. She led her party to win the July 1960 elections on the pledge to continue her husband's policies and to proceed with repatriation of the estate Tamils to India. On July 21, 1960, she became prime minister, becoming the first female prime minister in the world. [PAR] Within a year of her election, she declared a ""state of emergency"" following a civil disobedience campaign by the country's minority Tamil population. The state takeover of foreign businesses, including petroleum companies, led to more problems. Both the US and Britain ended aid to Sri Lanka to protest. She defeated an attempted coup in 1963, but lost a vote of confidence in 1964, and in 1965, the SLFP coalition was defeated. [PAR] She won a second term in the 1970 elections but her government was nearly toppled 16 months later by the 1971 JVP Insurrection, but was saved with military help from India and Pakistan. [PAR] During her second term, a new constitution was introduced in 1972. Ceylon was renamed Sri Lanka and became a republic. Under the old constitution, elections should have been held in 1975, but Bandaranaike used a clause of the new constitution to delay elections until 1977. This did not help, and her party lost the elections. [PAR] In 1980, Bandaranaike was charged with abuse of power for delaying the elections. She was expelled from parliament and banned from public office for seven years. Banadaranaike spent the next seventeen years fending off challenges to her leadership of the SLFP, but managed to maintain control. [PAR] In 1994, when the SLFP-led coalition won the general elections, Bandaranaike's daughter Chandrika outmanuevered her mother to become prime minister and then was elected President that year. [PAR] Although Bandaranaike then became prime minister again, the constitution had changed since her last tenure, making the position subordinate to the president. She had little real power.

"[DOC] [TLE] Don't Look Now (1973) - Rotten Tomatoes - Movie TrailersSuper Reviewer [PAR] ½ [PAR] A chilling thriller that parallels climactic highs with psychedelic horror, this film uses its understated source material to drive the tension forward superbly, and remains artfully directed and shot the entire way through. Using an original short story from the queen of literary gothic horror, Daphne du Maurier, we meet a family in a British country home, the father working on church restorations. Tragically their daughter drowns while trying to retrieve a ball in the creek behind their home, their son unharmed. The couple are obviously devastated, but the husband, John (Sutherland) feels the burden even more because he had a psychic vision of the incident before it happened. John keeps having these unfortunate visions even as he and his wife, Laura (Christie) escape to Venice while he reconstructs yet another church. While in the city the couple experience the strange and abundantly weird aura of the city, clandestine circumstances seemingly surround them starting with their introduction to a couple of sisters, one being blind and psychic. The psychic tries to reconnect their daughter to them via trances and seances, and Laura believes every word, whether it's true or not. John is hesitant to believe, and in that disbelief he becomes disenchanted, following around a small red caped figure who looks, from behind, like his deceased daughter. John goes on to see other strange things, almost dies during a work accident, and chases down the caped figure and his wife, possibly brainwashed, around Venice. The circumstances of the thriller are very chilly, because not only does John constantly experience chances at seeing who he believes to be his daughter, but he and his wife are also trying to reconnect to each other after her death. Neither believes the other is completely sane, and that lends to a distrust between the couple, us the audience, and everyone else within the film. The mood is set as being distrustful and surreptitiously haunted, using distinct cinematography and a disconnect in language that occurs with the setting. The couple's own connection to one another is well established thanks to a very explicit and very passionate love scene, and the twist ending ties together so many miscellaneous odds and ends that it is not only strange but also brilliant. Moody and dark, this film embodies so many genre characteristics and yet remains intact as its own entity, making it one of the best horror films, and beyond genre films, perhaps ever made. [PAR] Spencer S. [PAR] Super Reviewer [PAR] ½ [PAR] A married couple mourning their child go to Venice where they meet a pair of creepy old ladies who claim to speak for their dead daughter. A thoroughly uninspired thriller, this film fails to chill or excite.  The quick cuts - I call them ""flash edits"" - do nothing to enhance the film's suspense; rather, they just distract attention from the film's action and induce an epileptic fit.  The dramatic question is supposed to be how the prognosticators' predictions will come true, but it didn't work for me.  And the ending comes out of nowhere; whereas a film like Momento made me marvel at the clever way the film's inevitable outcome came to pass, Don't Look Now just pulled some crazy shit out of its ass. The performances by Julie Christie, who is especially beautiful, and Donald Sutherland, who isn't but show it all anyway, are unremarkable, neither good nor bad.

There have been four series of Hell’s Kitchen in the UK since 2004 and a further five series, fronted by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, called Hell’s Kitchen USA in the States, with a sixth due to start in July 2009. [PAR] The programme seeks to teach up to 10 people how to cook. [PAR] The most recent UK version of Hell’s Kitchen featured Marco Pierre White in 2009, while the series was launched in 2004 by Gordon Ramsay. A second series, fronted by celebrity chefs Jean-Christophe Novelli and Gary Rhodes, was televised in 2005, while Marco took over the reins as head chef for the delayed third series, which was broadcast in September 2007. [PAR] The first three series of Hell’s Kitchen UK have been presented by Angus Deayton, but he was replaced for the fourth series by Claudia Winkleman after he fell out with Marco. In 2007, after the filming of the third series, Marco Pierre White signed a three-year golden handcuffs deal for £1.5m . Read more about Marco Pierre White on TV on this Caterersearch blog post. [PAR] SERIES 1 [PAR] In the first series, actress and singer Jennifer Ellison won the title after creating a signature dish of burger with chunky chips under the tutelage of Gordon Ramsay. The show ran daily for two weeks and featured celebrities Amanda Barrie, Belinda Carlisle, Dwain Chambers, Edwina Currie, James Dreyfus (runner up), Jennifer Ellison (winner), Matt Goss (third place), Al Murray, Abi Titmuss and Tommy Vance who replaced Roger Cook after he injured himself on the first night. [PAR] A follow-up programme was televised afterwards called Hell’s Kitchen: School Reunion, in which Ellison and the Hell’s Kitchen runner-up, James Dreyfus, joined forces to organise a healthy dinner service for the children at Gordon Ramsay’s former school. [PAR] SERIES 2 [PAR] Broadcast in spring 2005, the format of the second series was overhauled with celebrity chefs Jean-Christophe Novelli and Gary Rhodes heading up two kitchens. Ten members of the public were split into two kitchens which competed against each other with the 10 contests being voted off over a two-week period. Newcastle’s Terry Miller emerged victorious and won £250,000 to start his own restaurant. He subsequently launched Rockafella in Newcastle . [PAR] SERIES 3 [PAR] The third series was originally scheduled to begin in the summer of 2006 under the culinary direction of Jean-Christophe Novelli – until ITV decided to take a break from the show. Instead, it aired in September 2007 under Marco Pierre White. He took in  10 celebrities – Adele Silva (runner-up), Brian Dowling, Paul Young, Abigail Clancy, Jim Davidson, Rosie Boycott, Barry McGuigan (winner), Anneka Rice and Kelly LeBrock, Lee Ryan (left the show on day three) – through their paces with the help of Nick Munier , former manager of White’s Belvedere restaurant, Tim Payne and Matthew Brown. [PAR] SERIES 4 [PAR] The fourth and latest series kicked off on 13 April 2009 with eight celebrity would-be chefs – Adrian Edmondson, Anthea Turner, Bruce Grobbelaar, Danielle Bux, Grant Bovey, Linda Evans, Niomi McLean-Daley (aka Ms. Dynamite), and Jody Latham (the first to be eliminated, on day seven). Nick Munier and sous chefs Tim Payne and Matthew Brown returned to assist Marco who, this time round, gets to sack the celebrities while the public votes for the winner.

[PAR] Celebration\ Observance [PAR] All Saints day also known as All Hallows, Solemnity of All Saints and Feast of All Saints is celebrated November 1st in the West and the first Sunday after Pentecost in the East.  It honors all the Saints and often is celebrated through a feast.  The day celebrates that there is a spiritual connection between those in heaven and the living.  All Saints' Day is not a national federal holiday but is and observance for Christians to recognize all the Saints in the church. [PAR] History [PAR] Pope Gregory IV in 837 made all Saints' Day an official holiday.  There is speculation about the event being held on November 1, which is the same day as the pagan Festival of the Dead, which would compete with All Saints' Day.  Others say, All Saints' Day got its start back in the fourth century where Greek Christians celebrated a festival on the first Sunday after Pentecost in honor of Saints.  Today it is a nationally celebrated holiday.

The day is dedicated to the saints of the Church, that is, all those who have attained heaven. It should not be confused with All Souls' Day, which is observed on November 2, and is dedicated to those who have died and not yet reached heaven. [PAR] Although millions, or even billions of people may already be saints, All Saints' Day observances tend to focus on known saints --that is those recognized in the canon of the saints by the Catholic Church. [PAR] All Saints' Day is also commemorated by members of the Eastern Orthodox Church as well as some protestant churches, such as Anglican, Lutheran and Anglican churches. [PAR] Generally, All Saints' Day is a Catholic Holy Day of Obligation, meaning all Catholics are required to attend Mass on that day, unless they have an excellent excuse, such as serious illness. [PAR] Other countries have different rules according to their national bishop's conferences. The bishops of each conference have the authority to amend the rules surrounding the obligation of the day. [PAR] All Saints' Day was formally started by Pope Boniface IV, who consecrated the Pantheon at Rome to the Virgin Mary and all the Martyrs on May 13 in 609 AD. Boniface IV also established All Souls' Day, which follows All Saints. [PAR] The choice of the day may have been intended to co-opt the pagan holiday ""Feast of the Lamures,"" a day which pagans used to placate the restless spirits of the dead. [PAR] The holy day was eventually established on November 1 by Pope Gregory III in the mid-eighth century as a day dedicated to the saints and their relics. The May 13 celebration was subsequently abandoned. [PAR] In Ireland, the Church celebrated All Saints' Day on April 20, to avoid associating the day with the traditional harvest festivals and pagan feasts associated with Samhain, celebrated at the same time. [PAR] Following the establishment of the Frankish Empire, and following the reign of Charlemagne, the holy day, which was already celebrated on November 1, became a holy day of obligation by decree of Pope Gregory IV and Louis the Pious, who was king over a portion of Charlemagne's former empire. [PAR] Following the Protestant Reformation, many Protestants retained the holy day, although they dismissed the need to pray for the dead. Instead, the day has been used to commemorate those who have recently died, usually in the past year, and to remember the examples of those who lived holy lives.

"[DOC] [TLE] Jerez Wine | Sherry Wine Types: Fino, Manzanilla ...Jerez Wine | Sherry Wine Types: Fino, Manzanilla, Amontillado. Oloroso y Palo Cortado [PAR] Spanish wines » Sherry » Jerez Types [PAR] Types of Spanish Sherry [PAR] Thanks to the long history of Sherry in Spain as well as the creativeness of the Sherry makers in the country, there are a number of different varieties of the wine available today; each with its own name, technique and flavour. [PAR] Fino [PAR] Fino Sherries are the driest and palest of the various types of Spanish Sherry. Compared to the other varieties, they are not aged as long and should be drunk as soon as possible after opening the bottle as the exposure to air can lead to the wine losing its flavour. [PAR] This type of Sherry owes its light and fresh flavour to the yeast used in its production. The flor yeast forms a protective layer over the top of the wine when it is being aged, which shields the wine from over oxidation. This technique was not fully understood until way into the 19th century. [PAR] Fino Sherry is to be served chilled, at a temperature between 7 and 10°C. Often the Sherry is served before a meal, but you might also see people drinking Sherry with some Spanish tapas when you visit Spain. [PAR] Manzanilla [PAR] Manzanilla is another form of fine, dry Sherry which is produced around the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda. Manzanilla Sherry is made in the same way as fino Sherry however; the cool sea temperatures mean that the yeast often grows better. The resulting thicker layer of yeast protects the wine from the air even further; giving the Sherry an even finer and more delicate flavour than other fino Sherries. [PAR] There is an ongoing dispute surrounding the name of this variety of Spanish Sherry however. Some people believe that it is named after apples as it tastes a little bit like the fruit. Others believe that it tastes like chamomile tea which is often known as manzanilla in Spain. Other theories claim that the grape vine used at the beginning of the existence of this drink was called manzanilla and that the wines resemble those that came from the town of Manzanilla during the 15th century. [PAR] Manzanilla Sherry is best drunk when chilled to a temperature of 7-10°C, and goes particularly well with Spanish tapas such as olives, almonds, Jamón serrano or seafood. This Sherry variety should also been consumed as soon as possible, just like finos, as the wine can lose its flavour very quickly. [PAR] Amontillado [PAR] The Amontillado Sherry is a Sherry that is darker than a fino but still lighter than an oloroso. Normally, an amontillado begins as a fino Sherry which contains around 13.5% alcohol. The cap of yeast though that makes a fino is the key to amontillado as well, however it is the inadequacy of such layer that makes the wine. Without this layer, the amontillado Sherry has to be fortified until it contains 17.5% alcohol, after which the Sherry is allowed to slowly oxidise in porous oak casks. The resulting Sherry is therefore darker in colour and richer in flavour than a fino. [PAR] The name for this type of Spanish Sherry comes from the Spanish region of Montilla, which is where the variety of Sherry originally began to be produced during the 18th century. However, sometimes the term is used to describe any Sherry that has a colour between a fino and an oloroso Sherry. [PAR] Amontillado is normally served chilled as is often drunk as an aperitif or to accompany food such as chicken or rabbit. This type of Sherry is much more stable than fino and can be stored for a few years before opening. Furthermore, if corked and refrigerated, an amontillado can keep up to two weeks. [PAR] Oloroso [PAR] Oloroso Sherry, which those of you who study Spanish will know means 'scented' or 'pungent' in Spanish, is a darker Sherry than amontillado as it is produced by a longer period of oxidation. This Sherry has a high glycerine content which tends to make it smoother and less dry in taste. [PAR] The yeast layer on the Sherry is suppressed earlier by fortification which then exposes the wine to oxygen.

[PAR] Michael Jackson holds his young son over a fourth-floor balcony railing in Berlin. [PAR] By Tobias Schwarz, Reuters [PAR] After video images of the squirming baby in a blue jumper shocked viewers in Europe and the United States, the reclusive pop legend issued a statement saying he made a ""terrible mistake"" by holding Prince Michael II aloft from a window 60 feet off the ground. [PAR] The boy's face was draped with a white cloth, which German newspapers reported was a precaution to protect his children from being kidnapped. [PAR] ""I got caught up in the excitement of the moment,"" Jackson's statement said. ""I would never intentionally endanger the lives of my children."" [PAR] British tabloids were especially critical of Jackson. The Sun called him ""You lunatic"" and the Daily Mirror, ""Mad bad dad."" In New York, the Daily News front page called Jackson ""Wacko!"" while the New York Post proclaimed ""Jacko goes over the edge."" [PAR] ""The Berlin police should arrest this negligent father for reckless endangerment of his own child,"" the Mirror's show business editor, Kevin O'Sullivan, wrote. [PAR] Berlin prosecutors said they were not investigating the incident, although an inquiry could be opened if any complaint were filed against Jackson. [PAR] Jackson had plenty of supporters and appeared unfazed by the trans-Atlantic flap as he toured Berlin on Wednesday, taking two of his children, their faces covered with burgundy-colored scarves, to see gorillas at the Berlin Zoo. [PAR] At one point on the zoo tour, Jackson, protected by bodyguards, shielded his two children from photographers with a large, black umbrella. [PAR] He even dared to appear again at the same balcony window — this time with two smiling German children waving next to him. Young Prince Michael II, however, was no where to be seen. [PAR] Little is known about Jackson's youngest son, but People magazine reported in August that he was six months old and that he had not been adopted; however, no mother was identified. [PAR] The singer's 5-year-old son Prince Michael and 4-year-old daughter Paris were born during his marriage to Debbie Rowe, which ended in 1999. [PAR] While fans and friends alike said they could not imagine ever holding a child over a railing from such a height, they seemed to agree Jackson meant no harm. [PAR] ""He probably did it because he was overwhelmed emotionally by the fans,"" spoon-bending psychic and Jackson friend Uri Geller said in London. ""I think it was a silly thing to do."" [PAR] Jackson came to Berlin to receive a Bambi entertainment lifetime achievement award Thursday, taking a break from California hearing on a lawsuit seeking damages for canceling two concerts. [PAR] On Wednesday night, the star attended a celebrity auction for homeless children, where a silver-studded jacket that he wore to receive the Artist of the Century title at last January's American Music Awards was sold for $16,000 to German songwriter Ralph Siegel.

These curves help to better absorb the loads applied to the spine from the weight of the body. The cervical spine (neck) and lumbar spine (lower back) are have a normal inward curvature that is medically referred to as lordosisor ""lordotic"" curvature by which the spine is bent backward. The thoracic spine (upper back) has a normal outward curvature that is medically referred to as kyphosis or the ""kyphotic"" curve by which the spine is bent forward. In this discussion, the term kyphosis will be used to discuss abnormal kyphosis. [PAR] The spine is normally straight when looking from the front. An abnormal curve when viewed from the front is called scoliosis . Scoliosis can occur from  bony abnormalities of the spine at birth, growth abnormalities especially with  adolescence, degenerative spinal changes in adulthood, or abnormal twisting of the vertebrae  because of muscle spasm after an injury. [PAR] The normal curves of the spine allow the head to be balanced directly over the pelvis. If one or more of these curves is either too great or too small, the head may not be properly balanced over the pelvis. This can lead to back pain , stiffness, and an altered gait or walking pattern.

[PAR] After all, Bergman had been advertised as one of Hollywood’s most “normal” and “wholesome” star, living an idyllic family life. By that time, she had won a well deserved Best Actress at her second nomination, in 1944, for George Cukor’s suspenseful thriller-melodrama, Gaslight. [PAR] Bergman’s screen roles, particularly Sister Mary Benedict in The Bells of St. Mary’s, in 1945, and in some of Hitchcock’s movies (Spellbound in 1945), perpetuated that image. [PAR] Bergman’s affair with Rossellini, while officially married to another man, made her the subject of a most vicious campaign. Fan magazines, the church, and even school organizations condemned her, and there was serious talk of boycotting her films in the United States. [PAR] Free-Love Cultist, Common Mistress [PAR] Senator Edwin C. Johnson denounced Bergman on the Senate floor as “a free-love cultist,” and “common mistress,” “a powerful influence for evil,” and “Hollywood’s apostle of degradation,” demanding that she be barred forever from the country on grounds of “moral turpitude.” [PAR] For almost a decade, Bergman was “persona non grata” in the United States. Unfortunately, none of the pictures that she made with Rossellini was commercially successful. Neither artist benefited much from their professional collaboration; Bergman’s star charisma was somehow foreign to Rossellini’s neorealistic style that, among other things, relied on the use of nonprofessional actors. Soon the marriage itself was in troubled waters. [PAR] However, in 1955, producer Darryl Zanuck came to the rescue, offering Bergman the lead in Anastasia, as the amnesiac refugee who’s passing as Tzar Nicholas and Alexandra’s surviving daughter. This was done against the advice of Fox’s executives who believed that the American public had not forgiven Bergman yet. But with Zanuck’s insistence and a new publicity campaign, which now sold Bergman as a courageous woman who sacrificed her career and family for true love, her image began to change.

He responded by writing a part for her in his 1949 film ""Stromboli.""  During the production of this film, Ingrid and Rossellini began an affair that would change her previous wholesome image forever and cause her to lose many fans in America. Ingrid was still married to Petter Lindstrom at the time, although their marriage had not been happy for many years. Rossellini was still married to another woman as well, although they were separated. Ingrid became pregnant, and she and Rossellini sought divorces from their respective spouses so they could marry each other. Ingrid gave birth to a son, Roberto, before the couple were married in 1950. Moralists and fans in America expressed outrage at this seeming downfall of their former idol and denounced her as immoral. Although her marriage had been unhappy for quite some time, the public had only seen Ingrid's saintly image before, and balked at the revelation of her affair. United States Senator Edwin C.

"[DOC] [TLE] The Bottle InnThe Bottle Inn is a 16th-century public house in Marshwood in Dorset, England which hosts the World Nettle Eating Championship. The building started life as an ale house being close to a church where people came to pay their tithes. It was named The Bottle Inn sometime late in the 18th Century when it became the first inn in the area to sell bottled beers. During its history the building has also housed the village shop and during World War II, the village school. The  Bottle Inn was purchased as a Free House in 1982 from Ushers Brewery by Michael and Pauline Brookes. Through their hard work they built up not only the food trade but also the local trade, establishing skittle teams, dart teams, table skittle teams and domino teams. This pub has always been a popular destination for holiday makers en route to and from the coast in the summer months.   [PAR] World Nettle Eating Championship [PAR] The Bottle Inn hosts the annual World Nettle Eating Championships as part of a charity beer festival.  Competitors are served  long stalks of stinging nettles from which they pluck and eat the leaves. After an hour the bare stalks are measured and the winner is the competitor with the greatest accumulated length of nettles. The contest began in the late 1980s when two farmers argued over who had the longest stinging nettles in their field and evolved into the World Nettle Eating Championships when one of the farmers promised to eat any nettle which was longer than his. The championship has separate men’s and women’s sections and attracts competitors from as far afield as Canada and Australia.  [PAR] In June 2010 Sam Cunningham, a fishmonger from Somerset won the contest, after eating 74 ft of nettles.  [PAR] In June 2014 Phillip Thorne, a chef from Colyton, Devon won the contest, after eating 80 ft of nettles.[DOC] [TLE] Britons braced to grasp nettle - and eat it | IOLBritons braced to grasp nettle - and eat it | IOL [PAR] Britons braced to grasp nettle - and eat it [PAR] Back Page / 17 June 2005, 12:23pm [PAR] By Gideon Long [PAR] London - A handful of hardy souls will descend on a quiet English village this weekend to stuff their mouths full of stinging nettles in a bizarre competition which started as an argument in a pub. [PAR] Combatants will gather at The Bottle Inn in Marshwood, south-west England, on Saturday night to take part in the 9th annual World Nettle Eating Championship. [PAR] It is a mouth-watering prospect. [PAR] Competitors must pluck and eat as many leaves as they can from the feathery, stinging plants in the space of one hour. Their achievement is measured in feet and inches - the combined length of the bare stems they discard. [PAR] ""You have to adopt the correct technique to stand any chance of winning,"" said Shane Pym, landlord of the Bottle Inn (www.thebottleinn.co.uk). [PAR] ""The art is to fold the top of the leaf inwards, get it past the lips, crunch it and then get it down the neck. You can't let your mouth get dry or you will get stung."" [PAR] The championship has a short but colourful history. [PAR] It started in 1986 as a heated argument in the pub between two farmers who both claimed that the nettles at the back of their silage pits were the longest. [PAR] The landlady of the Bottle Inn intervened and declared an competition to resolve the dispute. Other farmers were also invited to take part. [PAR] Three years later, local man Alex Williams threw down a gauntlet to his rivals in the shape of a nettle measuring 4,7 metres. If anyone could produce a longer one, he boasted, he would eat it. [PAR] For the next eight years, Williams was forced - almost literally - to eat his words. Each year, someone would step forward with a longer nettle and, each year, Williams would dutifully chomp his way though it. [PAR] In 1997, the event evolved in to a straight fight to eat the most nettles, a format which has endured until now. [PAR] The rules are strict.

On reflection, Winona Ryder believes her conviction was blown out of proportion, but concedes it gave her an opportunity to take a much-needed break from the film industry.

'Its that line in First Wives Club ""There are three ages for women: babe, district attorney and Driving Miss Daisy!"" I just never got to play that district attorney.' While many of her contemporaries have tried their hand at directing or producing movies, Winona admitted she had no such desire. She added: 'I can only see my own characters point of view! Im just not a business person, you know? I wish I was in a way. But acting still excites me. I dont sleep the day before a new job. Im sure its psychosomatic but still.'

"[DOC] [TLE] The Original Names of 10 Cartoon Characters | Mental FlossThe Original Names of 10 Cartoon Characters | Mental Floss [PAR] The Original Names of 10 Cartoon Characters [PAR] YouTube [PAR] Like us on Facebook [PAR] Like most kids, you probably grew up watching all the standard cartoon characters—Mickey, Tweety, and Betty Boop. But had different decisions been made, your Saturday mornings might have been occupied by Mortimer, Orson, and Nan instead. Read on to find out what 10 of your favorite cartoon characters were nearly named. [PAR] 1. Tweety Bird was Orson [PAR] In this 1942 short, Tweety Bird managed to evade a comedic feline duo named Babbit and Catstello. Though Tweety's not specifically named in the cartoon, the staff called him “ Orson ” on the model sheet. It wasn’t until his second appearance in a short called “Birdy and the Beast” that Tweety received the name we all know him by today. [PAR] 2. Mickey Mouse was Mortimer [PAR] Walt Disney planned on naming his most famous character “Mortimer,” but wife Lillian intervened. She felt that Mortimer didn’t quite fit, and suggested the friendlier-sounding “Mickey” as an alternative. Disney later added a “Mortimer Mouse” to the lineup as a rival for Minnie’s affections. [PAR] 3. Pluto was Rover [PAR] Not only did Pluto have a different name in his first couple of cartoons, he was also Minnie’s dog, not Mickey’s. Walt didn’t think “Rover” had staying power, so he considered  names like Pal and Homer before settling on something a bit more distinctive. The dog’s first appearance as Pluto was in a cartoon that debuted in October 1930, just a few months after the discovery of Pluto on February 18, 1930. [PAR] 4. Goofy was Dippy Dawg [PAR] When Goofy debuted in a 1932 cartoon called “Mickey’s Revue,” he had a beard and glasses and was called “Dippy Dawg.” By “Orphan’s Benefit” in 1934, he had found the name we know him by today. There’s also a 1950s incarnation of Goofy who went by the name “ George Geef .” [PAR] 5. Elmer Fudd was Egghead [PAR] There’s some controversy over whether Egghead was the dimwitted hunter’s original name or a completely different character entirely. Egghead, a character with a bulbous noggin and khaki-colored hunting clothes, first appeared in Tex Avery’s 1937 cartoon “Egghead Rides Again.” The character was in a handful of shorts under that name before a more refined version shows up in the 1940 toon “Elmer’s Candid Camera.” Here’s a bit of an Egghead cartoon—decide for yourself. [PAR] 6. Betty Boop was Nancy Lee or Nan McGrew [PAR] Before she was a leading lady, Betty Boop was often a supporting character in Fleischer Studios cartoons, going by the name Nancy Lee or Nan McGrew. She was also originally a poodle. Over time, her floppy ears morphed into hoop earrings and she was given a button nose. [PAR] 7. Mighty Mouse was Super Mouse [PAR] The diminutive superhero starred in seven shorts under “ Super Mouse, the Mouse of Tomorrow ,” wearing colors similar to Superman’s. But it wasn’t the rodent’s similarity to Kal-El that caused the name switch—it was the debut of a Coo Coo Comics character that also went by “Super Mouse.” To prevent confusion, Terrytoons simply decided to make their mouse “Mighty” instead. [PAR] 8. Yosemite Sam had at least three other potential names [PAR] Yosemite Sam’s creators agreed that the rootin’ tootin’ gunslinger had to have a Western-like name; they discussed “Wyoming Willie,” ""Texas Tiny,” and “Denver Dan” before landing on the current memorable moniker. [PAR] 9 and 10. Tom and Jerry were Jasper and Jinx [PAR] In their first cartoon “Puss Gets the Boot,” the famous cat and mouse duo were named Jasper and Jinx, though Jasper is the only one mentioned by name. William Hanna and Joe Barbera didn’t feel the names “clicked,” so they tested names until one of them (Hanna doesn’t remember who) came",Mortimer was the original name for which famous cartoon mouse?,['mickey mouse'],fcac6f9e751f40a88ec0db79f6ac676e,"[{'end': [941], 'start': [930]}]","∃x (OriginalName(x, ""Mortimer"") ∧ FamousCartoonMouse(x))"

The track, which was to achieve greater commercial success when reissued in 1979, was included on Jackson's debut album, Look Sharp!. [PAR] Background [PAR] According to Joe Jackson, the song originated from when he heard the title. From there, he came up with the basis for the song lyrics of ""pretty women"" dating ""gorillas."" He said of the songs origins in an interview: [PAR] Initially being released as a single in 1978, the song saw little chart success, failing to chart in both Britain and America. However, when the single was reissued in the summer of 1979 (catalogue number AMS 7459), the song saw greater success, reaching #13 in Britain and #21 in America.  It also appeared in the charts in Australia, Canada and the Netherlands.  [PAR] The UK B-side of the single, ""You Got the Fever"" was a non-album track that later appeared as a bonus track on later reissues of Look Sharp! In the U.S., however, ""(Do the) Instant Mash,"" which also appeared on Look Sharp!, was issued as the B-side instead. [PAR] An alternate recording of the song was released as the B-side to Jackson's 1981 single, ""Beat Crazy."" The song was featured in the 1998 romantic comedy film, There's Something About Mary, The Simpsons episode ""Rome-Old and Juli-Eh"" and Live From Daryl's House episode No. 3 with the Plain White T's.

Polycerate (multi-horned) sheep breeds include the Hebridean, Icelandic, Jacob, Manx Loaghtan, and the Navajo-Churro. [PAR] Horns usually have a curved or spiral shape, often with ridges or fluting. In many species only males have horns. Horns start to grow soon after birth, and continue to grow throughout the life of the animal (except in pronghorns, which shed the outer layer annually, but retain the bony core). Partial or deformed horns in livestock are called scurs. Similar growths on other parts of the body are not usually called horns, but spurs, claws or hoofs depending on the part of the body on which they occur. [PAR] Other hornlike growths [PAR] The term ""horn"" is also popularly applied to other hard and pointed features attached to the head of animals in various other families: [PAR] * Giraffidae: Giraffes have one or more pairs of bony bumps on their heads, called ossicones.  These are covered with furred skin. [PAR] * Cervidae: Most deer have antlers, which are not true horns.  When fully developed, antlers are dead bone without a horn or skin covering; they are borne only by adults (usually males, except for reindeer) and are shed and regrown each year. [PAR] * Rhinocerotidae: The ""horns"" of rhinoceroses are made of keratin, the same substance as fingernails, and grow continuously, but do not have a bone core. [PAR] *Chamaeleonidae: Many chameleons, most notably the Jackson's Chameleon, possess horns on their skulls, and have a keratin covering. [PAR] * Ceratopsidae: The ""horns"" of the Triceratops were extensions of its skull bones although debate exists over whether they had a keratin covering. [PAR] * Horned lizards (Phrynosoma): These lizards have horns on their heads which have a hard keratin covering over a bony core, like mammalian horns. [PAR] * Insects: Some insects (such as rhinoceros beetles) have horn-like structures on the head or thorax (or both).  These are pointed outgrowths of the hard chitinous exoskeleton.  Some (such as stag beetles) have greatly enlarged jaws, also made of chitin. [PAR] * Canidae: Golden jackals are known to occasionally develop a horny growth on the skull, which is associated with magical powers in south-eastern Asia.   [PAR] Many mammal species in various families have tusks, which often serve the same functions as horns, but are in fact oversize teeth. These include the Moschidae (Musk deer, which are ruminants), Suidae (Wild Boars), Proboscidea (Elephants), Monodontidae (Narwhals) and Odobenidae (Walruses). [PAR] Polled animals or pollards are those of normally-horned (mainly domesticated) species whose horns have been removed, or which have not grown.  In some cases such animals have small horny growths in the skin where their horns would be – these are known as scurs. [PAR] On humans [PAR] Cutaneous horns are the only examples of horns growing on people. They are most often benign growths and can be removed by a razor. [PAR] Cases of people growing horns have been historically described, sometimes with mythical status.  Researchers have not however discovered photographic evidence of the phenomenon. (Literature Reviews) There are human cadaveric specimens that show outgrowings, but these are instead classified as osteomas or other excrescences. [PAR] The phenomenon of humans with horns has been observed in countries lacking advanced medicine. There are living people, several in China, with cases of cutaneous horns, most common in the elderly.  [PAR] Some people, notably The Enigma, have horn implants; that is, they have implanted silicone beneath the skin as a form of body modification.

Mainstays were main composer Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on guitar, Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone, Garry Gary Beers on bass, and main lyricist Michael Hutchence on vocals For 20 years, INXS were fronted by Hutchence, whose ""sultry good looks"" and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their new wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style, including funk and dance elements.In the early 1980s, INXS first charted in their native Australia with their debut self-titled album, but later garnered moderate success elsewhere with Shabooh Shoobah and a single, ""The One Thing"". Though The Swing brought more success from around the world, its single ""Original Sin"" was even greater commercially, becoming their first number-one single. They would later achieve international success with a series of hit recordings through later in the 1980s and the 1990s, including the albums Listen Like Thieves, Kick, and X; and the singles ""What You Need"", ""Need You Tonight"", ""Devil Inside"", ""New Sensation"", and ""Suicide Blonde"".In the 1990s, INXS brought a new audience following Hutchence's romance with pop singer, Kylie Minogue, and achieved greater acclaim in the UK. However, starting with Welcome to Wherever You Are, in 1992, they achieved less success in the United States. Michael Hutchence was found dead in his hotel suite in Sydney in November 1997 and INXS did not perform publicly for a year. They made appearances with several guest singers including Jimmy Barnes, Terence Trent D'Arby, and Jon Stevens; Stevens formally joined the band for a tour and recording session in 2002. In 2005, members of INXS participated in Rock Star: INXS, a reality television series, broadcast worldwide, culminating in the selection of their new lead singer, Canadian J.D. Fortune, and the release of ""Pretty Vegas"" and ""Afterglow"" as singles, and its album Switch.In late 2010, they recorded and released Original Sin, a tribute album, featuring guest artists such as Kavyen Temperley (of Eskimo Joe) and Ben Harper. In September 2011 the band announced that Northern Irish singer-songwriter Ciaran Gribbin had replaced Fortune as their lead vocalist ahead of a planned tour of South America, Australia & Europe later in the year.INXS won six Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) awards including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992, and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001. As of May 2013 INXS have sold close to 40 million records worldwide.On 11 November 2012, during their performance as support act to Matchbox Twenty at Perth Arena, Australia, INXS announced that the performance would be their last.Early yearsThe origins of the band began with Andrew Farriss convincing his fellow Davidson High School classmate, Michael Hutchence, to join his band, Doctor Dolphin. The band contained two other classmates, Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders and a bass player, Garry Beers and Geoff Kennely, from a nearby high school, Forest High School. In 1977, Tim Farriss, Andrew's older brother, invited Andrew, Hutchence and Beers to join him and his schoolmate Kirk Pengilly. Tim and Pengilly had been playing together since 1971 as either an acoustic duo, Kirk and Tim, or as a four-piece band called Guinness (named after their bass player's dog). Together with younger brother Jon Farriss they formed the Farriss Brothers, who consisted of Garry Beers on bass guitar, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar, Geoff Kennelly on drums, Michael Hutchence on lead vocals and Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone.

Valli was not in the movie, but another Frankie was: Frankie Avalon played the Teen Angel and sang "" Beauty School Dropout ."" Valli would get a turn in acting: he appeared in seven episodes of the HBO series The Sopranos, which was about a quirky mafia family. [PAR] This song was written and produced by Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees specifically for the movie. His music helped make Saturday Night Fever a huge hit two years earlier. That film was produced by Robert Stigwood, who was a partner in the Grease movie and got Gibb on board for the title song. [PAR] For this project, Stigwood was interested in Gibb's pen, but not his voice, since The Bee Gees sound ingrained with Saturday Night Fever and he wanted Grease to have its own identity. Frankie Valli , who could sing in a similar high vocal range to Gibb, was asked to record it. Thanks to his many previous hits, Valli provided a familiar sound, but one that was not saturated on Pop radio, as he hadn't had a hit for a while. Gibb did sing backup on the track. [PAR] Speaking with Billboard magazine in a 2013 interview, Valli explained how he came to record this song. ""Barry Gibb called and said, 'I wrote a song. I think it's for you. It's going to be the title song for this motion picture,"" Valli recalled. ""My manager at the time was Allan Carr, who was partners in Grease with Robert Stigwood. He called and said, 'What do you want to do? Do you want to be in the movie? Or sing the title song?' Well, I had already heard the title song, and I loved it. I called [famed arranger] Don Costa up and told him to come over right away and hear this song. He said, 'If you don't record this song, you're crazy.' So I said, 'What's the song if I want to be in the movie?' And they said 'Beauty School Dropout.' It was done by Frankie Avalon. It never became a hit, but he made a lot of money from it being on the soundtrack. But 'Grease' was one of the biggest records I ever had in my career."" [PAR] This was not used in the stage production of Grease - it was written specifically for the movie. [PAR] The song doesn't make any specific references to the movie, but elegantly expresses it's theme: individuality. It explicitly empowers the title: [PAR] It's got a groove, it's got a meaning [PAR] Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion [PAR] Grease is the way we are feeling [PAR] In the bridge, the song gets transcendental: [PAR] This is a life of illusion [PAR] A life of control [PAR] Mixed with confusion [PAR] This was quite a departure for Valli: the Jersey Boy typically sang about girls and romance, not spiritual discovery. [PAR] This was Valli's second US #1 hit as a solo artist. Three years earlier, he hit the top spot with "" My Eyes Adored You ,"" and before that he had an astonishing five #1 hits with The Four Seasons. [PAR] When he was approached about ""Grease,"" Valli didn't have a record deal - the single was released on  Robert Stigwood's RSO label, which issued the soundtrack. Valli quickly landed a deal with Warner Brothers, but never scored another hit on the Hot 100. [PAR] ""Grease"" was Valli's only #1 not co-written by Bob Crewe or Bob Gaudio. [PAR] Peter Frampton played lead guitar on this track. [PAR] With its Disco beat, this song is way out place for the '50s, which is when Grease takes place.

The most well-known trisomy is Trisomy 21--3 copies of the 21st pair, otherwise known as Down Syndrome.

"[DOC] [TLE] The Yorkshire Ripper | Documentary Heavenrss [PAR] / 2 Comments [PAR] Peter William Sutcliffe (born 2 June 1946) is a British serial killer known as “The Yorkshire Ripper”. In 1981 Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others. [PAR] Sutcliffe was a regular user of prostitutes in Leeds and Bradford. His obsession with killing streetwalkers seems to have originated with an argument over payment, but he claimed he was being guided by the voice of God. [PAR] He carried out the murders over a five-year period, during which the public were especially shocked by the murders of some pedestrians who were not prostitutes. When arrested in January 1981 for driving with false number-plates, police questioned him about the killings and he confessed that he was the perpetrator. [PAR] At his trial, he pleaded not guilty to murder on grounds of diminished responsibility as he had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, but his defence was rejected by the jury. He is serving 20 sentences of life imprisonment in Broadmoor High Security Hospital. After his conviction, Sutcliffe began using his mother’s maiden name and became known as Peter William Coonan. [PAR] West Yorkshire Police were criticised for their slowness in apprehending Sutcliffe, despite interviewing him nine times during the murder hunt. Owing to the sensational nature of the case, they were having to handle an exceptional volume of information, some of it vexatious, including a major distraction caused by a hoax phone-call purporting to be from the ‘Ripper’. Nevertheless, serious criticism was confirmed in the 2006 Byford Report of the official enquiry. [PAR] The High Court dismissed an appeal by Sutcliffe in 2010, confirming that he would serve a whole life tariff and would never be released from prison.

"[DOC] [TLE] Paddington BearPaddington Bear is a fictional character in children's literature. He first appeared on 13 October 1958 and has been featured in more than twenty books written by Michael Bond and illustrated by Peggy Fortnum and other artists.  The friendly bear from deepest, darkest Peru—with his old hat, battered suitcase (complete with a secret compartment, enabling it to hold more items than it would at first appear), duffle coat and love of marmalade—has become a classic character from English children's literature.  Paddington books have been translated into 30 languages across 70 titles and sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. [PAR] Paddington is an anthropomorphised spectacled bear. He is always polite – addressing people as ""Mr"", ""Mrs"" and ""Miss"", rarely by first names – and kindhearted, though he inflicts hard stares on those who incur his disapproval. He has an endless capacity for innocently getting into trouble, but he is known to ""try so hard to get things right."" He was discovered in Paddington Station, London, by the (human) Brown family who adopted him, and thus he gives his full name as ""Paddington Brown"". As of June 2016, Paddington Bear and its copyright and trademark across the world are now owned by Vivendi's Studiocanal   [PAR] History  [PAR] Origin  [PAR] Michael Bond based Paddington Bear on a lone teddy bear he noticed on a shelf in a London store near Paddington Station on Christmas Eve 1956, which he bought as a present for his wife. The bear inspired Bond to write a story; and, in 10 days, he had written the first book. The book was given to his agent, Harvey Unna. A Bear Called Paddington was first published on 13 October 1958 by William Collins & Sons.   [PAR] Stuffed toy  [PAR] The first Paddington Bear stuffed toy to be manufactured was created in 1972 by Gabrielle Designs, a small business run by Shirley and Eddie Clarkson, with the prototype made as a Christmas present for their children Joanna and Jeremy Clarkson (who later became a well-known British TV presenter and writer). Shirley Clarkson dressed the stuffed bear in Wellington boots to help it stand upright. (Paddington received Wellingtons for Christmas in Paddington Marches On, 1964.) The earliest bears wore small children's boots manufactured by Dunlop Rubber until production could not meet demand. Gabrielle Designs then produced their own boots with paw prints moulded into the soles. [PAR] Shirley Clarkson's book  describes the evolution of the toy Paddington from Christmas gift to subject of litigation and ultimately commercial success. [PAR] Storyline  [PAR] In the first story, Paddington is found at Paddington railway station in London by the Brown family, sitting on his suitcase (bearing the label ""Wanted on Voyage"") with a note attached to his coat that reads ""Please look after this bear. Thank you."" Bond has said that his memories of newsreels showing trainloads of child evacuees leaving London during World War II, with labels around their necks and their possessions in small suitcases, prompted him to do the same for Paddington.  [PAR] Paddington arrives as a stowaway coming from ""Darkest Peru"", sent by his Aunt Lucy (one of his only known relatives aside from an Uncle Pastuzo who gave Paddington his hat)  who has gone to live in the Home for Retired Bears in Lima. He claims, ""I came all the way in a lifeboat, and ate marmalade. Bears like marmalade."" He tells them that no-one can understand his Peruvian name, so the Browns decide to call him Paddington after the railway station in which he was found. Paddington's Peruvian name is ultimately revealed to be ""Pastuso"" (not to be confused with his ""Uncle Pastuzo""). Bond originally wanted Paddington to have ""travelled all the way from darkest Africa"", but his agent advised him that there were no bears in darkest Africa, and thus it was amended to darkest Peru, home of the spectacled bear.[http://www.harperchildrens.com/hch/author/author/bond/interview2.asp Michael Bond and R.W.

[PAR] Category[DOC] [TLE] Don't Cry For Me Argentina by Julie Covington SongfactsDon't Cry For Me Argentina by Julie Covington Songfacts [PAR] Songfacts [PAR] This is the best-known song from the 1978 musical Evita, featuring music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. The show tells the story of Argentine political leader Eva Perón, the second wife of Argentinean president Juan Perón. This song appears early in the second act as Evita addresses the crowd from the balcony of the Casa Rosada. [PAR] Tim Rice's original inspiration for writing a musical about Eva Perón arose from listening to a BBC Radio 4 programme about the Argentine First Lady. [PAR] Both Tim Rice & Andrew Lloyd-Webber recognized the potential of this song but Rice thought the lyric might be too obscure for a pop single. He did rework it as ""It's Only Your Lover Returning,"" before the duo decided they still preferred ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina."" [PAR] Evita began as a rock opera concept album released in 1976 and Julie Covington was selected to sing the title role, including the vocals for this song. Released as a single, it topped the UK singles chart becoming at the time the biggest selling UK hit by a female vocalist with sales of 980,000 units. [PAR] Prior to recording this song, Covington was best known for her role in the TV series Rock Follies. She was later given the opportunity to originate the role in the stage production of Evita, but declined, explaining that she thought the impact of her recording would be diminished. Musical actress Elaine Paige took the role when the show opened on June 21, 1978, followed by Patti LuPone the following year on Broadway. [PAR] Covington refused to promote the song, not even appearing on Top Of The Pops. Tim Rice recalled in 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh: ""When the single began to show signs of being a hit, she got less and less interested in the project. She began to back away from it and began to feel it was a fascist plot, that we were exploiting the workers. I'm exaggerating a bit but she definitely disapproved of the success of 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina'."" [PAR] The song has been a hit on three other occasions. A 1978 instrumental version by The Shadows reached #5 in the UK, Mike Flowers Pops took it to #30 in the UK in 1996 and Madonna's 1997 recording, which she sung it for the movie version peaked at #3 in the UK and #8 in the US. Madonna's rendition reached #1 in several countries, most notably in France, where it became her second chart-topper.

Then he disappeared. When informed of the action, which could only be that of a pitiful madman, the police went the next day to his house and discovered him lying on his bed apparently at the point of death. The unfortunate man has been rushed to hospital. [PAR] Accounts of what took place that night vary. Whatever the exact circumstances, though, whatever underlying motivations could have compelled van Gogh to do it, the episode effectively put an end to one of the most famous working relationships in the history of art, as Paul Gauguin boarded the train to Paris the next day. [PAR] For nine weeks they had lived together sharing lodgings in the Yellow House, just outside the old town walls of Arles in the South of France, spurring each other on as collaborators and as rivals too.

[PAR] A brave face? [PAR] The painting, completed two weeks after the event, is often read as a farewell to that dream. For Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, the most recent biographers of the artist, however, the portrait was first and foremost a plea to van Gogh’s doctors.

His right ear is bandaged. It was in fact his left ear that was bandaged, the painting being a mirror image. To his right is an easel with a canvas on it. Barely visible, a faint outline underneath reveals what looks to be a still-life which appears to have been painted over. The top of the easel has been cropped by the edge of the canvas and the sitter's hat so as to form a fork-like shape. To his left is a blue framed window, and partly obscured by the gaunt ridge of his cheek, a Japanese woodblock print shows two geishas in a landscape with Mount Fuji in the background. [PAR] Naifeh and White Smith argue that van Gogh, following his release from hospital, was anxious to persuade his doctors that he was indeed perfectly fit and able to take care of himself and that, despite his momentary lapse, it would not be necessary for them to have him committed, as had been suggested, to one of the local insane asylums; hence the winter coat and hat, to keep warm as they had advised, and with the window ajar still getting that much-needed fresh air into his system.

Characters that appear in only one episode are not listed. This also includes information and characters from the feature film Top Cat: The Movie and the prequel film Top Cat Begins. [PAR] Core TV show characters [PAR] Top Cat [PAR] Top Cat (or simply T.C.) is the yellow-furred, charismatic, and clever main character of the series. He wears a mauve hat and vest. He often rips off and/or tricks minor characters, Officer Dibble, and even his own gang. He does respect the effort the gang does for him, but he often takes credit for it. That said, he is loyal to the gang and will help one of them if they need it. He also stops Officer Dibble from arresting him by lying to Dibble about how much talent Dibble has. He is voiced by Arnold Stang in the TV show, and by Daws Butler in Yogi's Ark Lark. [PAR] In the film, Top Cat: The Movie, he is again the main protagonist. His voice, by Jason Harris, is narrower and a bit lower-pitched. This version of the character has a romantic interest in Trixie. He also tells his gang that they only steal from people who deserve it. He is framed by Lou Strickland, who uses a robot look-alike to get him arrested, whereupon he is placed in a dog jail. [PAR] Benny the Ball [PAR] Benny, a blue-coloured cat with a white jacket that fastens with a single button at his neck, is T.C.'s right-hand man; they share a close friendship. He is short, innocent, chubby, and naïve. His eyes are shown as black dots unlike the other cats who have white sclerae with black pupils. Benny may appear to be simple-minded, due to the fact that he always gives the game away, but he manages to ask the most logical questions during the gang's erratic endeavors. A number of episodes have focused on Benny, including ""The Violin Player"", ""The Unscratchables"" and ""The Missing Heir"". He also made a cameo appearance on Kid vs. Kat in ""The Kat Whisperer"". Benny the Ball is modeled after his voice actor Maurice Gosfield in the TV series.  He was voiced by John Stephenson in Yogi's Ark Lark, Avery Schreiber in Top Cat and the Beverly Hills Cats, and Maurice LaMarche in Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law. [PAR] In the movie, he sometimes gets Top Cat and his gang in trouble, and his fandom of fictional musician Lazlo-Lazlo serves to introduce that character. In the film, his arms are slightly shorter and smaller, his voice, by Chris Edgerly, is a little bit clearer, and he is slightly more clumsy. [PAR] Choo-Choo [PAR] Choo-Choo (nicknamed Chooch by T.C. and the gang) is enthusiastic and devoted to T.C., even though often clueless as to what he is doing. He is a pink cat with a white turtleneck sweater and often depicted with the eyes of a Siamese cat. He lives at the fire house, as seen in the episode ""Hawaii Here We Come"". Choo-Choo is apparently a very skilled poker player, as stated by Top Cat in the episode ""The Golden Fleecing"".  He had a couple of love crushes, as seen in ""Choo-Choo's Romance"" and ""Choo-Choo Goes Gaga-Gaga"", however, unlike Fancy-Fancy or Top Cat, Choo-Choo has very little courage when talking to females.

"[DOC] [TLE] Roman Polanski arrested in Switzerland on 1977 rape chargesCele|bitchy | Roman Polanski arrested in Switzerland on 1977 rape charges [PAR] Roman Polanski arrested in Switzerland on 1977 rape charges [PAR] Arrests , Crime , Legal Issues , Legal Troubles , Roman Polanski [PAR] Back in 1977, director Roman Polanski was photographing a 13-year-old girl, Samantha Geimer, at his friend Jack Nicholson’s home.  Just days later, she accused Polanski of rape.  She claimed Polanski fed her champagne and prescription drugs, then raped her repeatedly.  At first, six charges were leveled at Polanski, and after the charges were filed, Polanski made a plea deal with the LA County’s district attorney in 1978. He pled guilty to “unlawful sexual intercourse” with an underage girl, and he was imprisoned for 42 days. [PAR] What happened then is rather sketchy, and there have been several different versions.  Some versions have Polanski simply not wanting to serve any additional time in any jail, as per his plea deal, which led to his fleeing the United States.  Other versions have a corrupt judge and/or district attorney who were trying to renege on the agreed-upon plea deal.   It’s very confusing, and I’m honestly not sure what really happened.  All I know is that in 1978, Roman Polanski fled the country on his French passport, and he’s never come back to the states once, not even to collect his Best Director Oscar for 2002’s The Pianist.  (Sidenote: Jack Nicholson collected Polanski’s Oscar, and hand-delivered it to him in France.) [PAR] Since 1978, Polanski has lived in France for the most part, making his films and enjoying his freedom.  The French authorities always claimed that they would not enforce an outstanding American extradition order because his crime was not covered by existing treaties between France and America.  This weekend, the 76-year-old Polanski set out from his French home to head to Switzerland.  He was due to receive a lifetime achievement award from Zurich Film Festival.  The Swiss police arrested and detained Polanski as soon as he entered the country, and they have every intention to extradite him to the United States: [PAR] Director Roman Polanski, who fled the United States in 1978 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl in California, has been arrested in Switzerland. [PAR] In a statement, the Zurich Film Festival, where Polanski, 76, was due to receive a lifetime achievement award, said the Oscar-winning director was held on his arrival in Switzerland Saturday. [PAR] A U.S. warrant for his arrest was issued when Polanski left the country more than 30 years ago before his sentencing. Polanski, a French citizen, has never returned to the U.S. since then and has sought to have the case against him dismissed. [PAR] The Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police, which confirmed Polanski’s arrest on an outstanding American warrant, added that a decision to extradite him to the U.S. is subject to judicial procedure. [PAR] “Why now?,” a friend of Polanski told PEOPLE on Sunday. “We don’t understand. Roman has been to Switzerland before so we don’t understand why he’s been arrested this time.” [PAR] Earlier this year, a California judge demanded that the director return to the U.S. in order to apply for dismissal – something Polanski has refused to do for fear of being arrested on arrival as a fugitive. [PAR] Polanski’s victim, Samantha Geimer, who has said she long ago moved on with her life, told PEOPLE in 1997, “If Polanski comes back – fine. That would at least end it. It will never be over until that happens.” [PAR] The Polish born filmmaker – whose films include Rosemary’s Baby, Chinatown and 2002′s The Pianist, for which he was named Best Director (Harrison Ford accepted on his behalf) – is married to French actress Emmanuelle Seigner and has two children, Morgane and Elvis.

"[DOC] [TLE] T'Pau (band)T'Pau are a British pop group led by singer Carol Decker. They had a string of Top 40 hits in the UK in the late 1980s, most notably ""China in Your Hand"",  ""Heart and Soul"" and ""Valentine"",  and several hits in Europe, before disbanding in the early 1990s. Decker still performs under the name T'Pau at solo shows and 1980s nostalgia concerts, and in 2013 she reunited with original bandmember and co-songwriter Ronnie Rogers for a 25th anniversary UK tour.  [PAR] History [PAR] The band formed in 1986 in Shropshire, taking their name from a Vulcan elder of the same name in the sci-fi series Star Trek.  Prior to deciding on this name, they were called Talking America on early demos sent to record and publishing companies. [PAR] Their first hit was the 1987 release ""Heart and Soul"". Initially a flop in the UK, it first became a hit in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, reaching No. 4 after being featured on a Pepe Jeans advertisement; it repeated the feat in the UK Singles Chart some months later. Their next single, ""China in Your Hand"", was their biggest UK hit, spending five weeks at number 1.  It also reached the top spot in several other European countries, but made little impact in the United States. Their debut album, Bridge of Spies (simply called T'Pau in the USA), also reached number 1 and went quadruple platinum in the UK. The album produced a total of five hit singles including ""Valentine"", ""Sex Talk"" (a live recording of early flop single, ""Intimate Strangers""), and ""I Will Be with You"". [PAR] 1988 saw the release of their second album Rage, which peaked at No. 4 in the UK and reached platinum status there, but failed to come close to the level of success of the band's debut album the year before. It produced the UK Top 20 single ""Secret Garden"", though chart returns were diminishing by this point, and two following singles earned very modest success. Third album The Promise followed in 1991: it peaked at No. 10 in the UK, earning a silver disc. It included one Top 20 hit, ""Whenever You Need Me"", but the band's commercial peak had now passed and they split up following its release. A compilation album, Heart and Soul – The Very Best of T'Pau, was released in 1993 and reached the UK Top 40. [PAR] Another greatest hits release appeared in 1997, and Decker reformed the band with a new line-up in 1998, for the release of a new studio album, Red. The record was not a commercial success, but T'Pau have continued to perform live on a semi-regular basis. Two singles ""With a Little Luck"" and ""Giving Up the Ghost"" were released from the album. Decker still made guest appearances on TV shows throughout the 2000s, including Hit Me, Baby, One More Time, Just the Two of Us and The Weakest Link. In 2007, marking the 20th anniversary of T'Pau's first success, Ron Rogers and Carol Decker released a new single, ""Just Dream"", exclusively as an Internet download. In 2008, T'Pau were part of the Here and Now 80s nostalgia tour.  [PAR] To mark the 25th anniversary of the formation of the band, Decker and Rogers embarked on a 28-date UK tour during the spring of 2013. [PAR] In February 2015, T'Pau released their fifth studio album, Pleasure & Pain, and embarked on a tour. The final eight shows on the Pleasure & Pain Tour had to be cancelled in early March after Decker suffered damage to her voice while suffering from bronchitis. Around the same time it emerged that she had also grown frustrated at a lack of airplay for her band's new material, as many radio stations were only interested in playing T'Pau's classic hits. In an interview she stated, ""It's a little harder to get on the radio because all the '80s stations play the '80s stuff and they won't play",The band T'Pau took their name from a character in which TV series?,['star trek'],82e44ac3809c49ad90ca56fff24e718f,"[{'end': [626], 'start': [618]}]","∃x (Series(x) ∧ CharacterInSeries(x, ""T'Pau""))"
"[DOC] [TLE] South America - 2012 Book ArchiveSouth America [PAR] Chapter 6 South America [PAR] Identifying the Boundaries [PAR] Europeans called the Western Hemisphere the New World. South America is the realm consisting of the southern portion of the New World. This realm includes the entire continent of South America, which is smaller in physical area than North America. As a continent, South America is larger in physical area than Europe, Antarctica, or Australia but is smaller in physical area than Africa or Asia. The South American continent is located farther east than North America and is smaller in physical area. Almost the entire landmass of South America lies to the east of the same meridian that runs through Miami, Florida. The Atlantic Ocean borders the continent to the east and the Pacific Ocean borders the continent on the west. The narrow Isthmus of Panama creates a natural break between the South American continent and its neighbors to the north. The Caribbean Sea creates the northern boundary. [PAR] The continent covers an extensive range of latitude. The equator cuts through the northern part of the continent directly through the mouth of the mighty Amazon River. The country of Ecuador is located on the equator—hence its name. The equatorial region is dominated by the tropical climates of the immense Amazon Basin. The Tropic of Capricorn runs directly through the latitude of São Paulo, Brazil, and Chile’s Atacama Desert, which reveals that most of the continent is in the zone of the tropics to the north. South of the Tropic of Capricorn is the Southern Cone of South America, home to the physical regions of the Pampas and Patagonia. Tierra del Fuego is the southern tip of the realm with territory in both Argentina and Chile. On the south side of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago is Cape Horn, which is considered the southernmost land point of the continent. The Diego Ramírez Islands south of Cape Horn mark the southern boundary of South America. [PAR] A number of noted island groups are usually affiliated with the physical region of South America. The Galapagos Islands are territorially a part of the country of Ecuador. The Falkland Islands, often referred to as the Malvinas, are located off the southern coast of Argentina. They are physically associated with South America but are administered and controlled by Great Britain as an overseas territory. Argentina has claimed the Falkland Islands and has battled Great Britain for them. Chile controls the noted Easter Island and the Robinson Crusoe Island in the Pacific Ocean. Various islands in the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean—such as the Dutch islands of Aruba, Curacao, and Bonaire—are sometimes associated with South America because of their proximity to the continent. They are included in Section 5.4 ""The Caribbean"" on the Caribbean and are more often associated with Middle America.

Precious metals have been mined from the mountains to grant great opportunities for those fortunate enough to be recipients of its wealth. Fossil fuels have been found in abundance in the far northern regions of Venezuela and Colombia. The Amazon Basin has been a source of hardwood lumber and, more recently, extensive mineral wealth.

The first person to portray the mean-green superhero was Lou Ferrigno in the Incredible Hulk TV series, which on the CBS network from 1978 to 1982 for a total of five seasons. Eric Bana was next in line with the 2003 film Hulk, followed by Edward Norton in The Incredible Hulk, and Mark Ruffalo in The Avengers, Iron Man 3, and the upcoming Marvel film The Avengers: Age of Ultron. [PAR] Lou Ferrigno – The Incredible Hulk TV series, The Incredible Hulk Returns TV movie, The Trial of the Incredible Hulk TV movie, The Death of the Incredible Hulk TV movie, The Incredible Hulk (voice only), The Avengers. [PAR] Eric Bana – Hulk [PAR] Edward Norton – The Incredible Hulk [PAR] Mark Ruffalo – The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Avengers: Age of Ultron [PAR] #2) Arnold Schwarzenegger Auctioned For The Hulk [PAR] Long before he was the Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger auditioned to play the Hulk in The Incredible Hulk TV series. The show's creator Kenneth Johnson wanted a tall, muscular actor to fill the shoes of the Hulk. According to post-show commentary, Schwarzenegger was too short to portray to the mean-green superhero, so they hired American actor Richard Kiel instead. This also proved problematic, though, since Kiel possessed an “under-developed” physique. [PAR] Kiel was soon replaced with professional bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno, who took the role and ran with it. The only scene in which Kiel appears is a short clip in the pilot episode. Kiel later revealed that he had an adverse reaction to the contacts he was required to wear, so he didn't mind giving up the role. [PAR] #3) The Hulk Was Supposed To Be Gray [PAR] Can you image a world in which the Incredible Hulk is gray? When the Hulk first appeared in the 1963 comics, Stan Lee wanted him to be gray. Due to the lack of consistent gray coloring with printing machines at the time, Lee and the rest of the team searched for an alternative color. [PAR] The problem with gray is that it bled onto other pages as the reader flipped through the comic. So even if Hulk appeared gray at the beginning, he would often change to black and shades thereof throughout the comic. Fans complained about the ink smearing on the pages, at which point Lee was forced to use a different color. The team ultimately chose the iconic green color for the Hulk, which is still being used today. [PAR] #4) Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde [PAR] You might be surprised to learn that Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde played a role in the Hulk's inception. Stan Lee reportedly combined traits from both characters to use in the Hulk. The Hulk has Frankenstein angry but relatable/likable mannerism and Dr. Jekyll/Mr.Hyde's uncontrollable personal-switching trait. [PAR] “It was patently apparent that [the monstrous character the] Thing was the most popular character in [Marvel's recently created superhero team the] Fantastic Four....

Hailing from Leeds, the group consists of vocalist Ricky Wilson, guitarist Andrew 'Whitey' White, bassist Simon Rix, keyboardist Nick 'Peanut' Baines, and drummer Nick Hodgson. They were named after the South African football club Kaizer Chiefs, a team which former Leeds United defender Lucas Radebe played for. [PAR] The group's debut album, Employment, was released in 2005. It was primarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of late 1970s, and enjoyed international success with sales of over three million. In 2005, the album was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize. Kaiser Chiefs' second album, Yours Truly, Angry Mob (2007), yielded ""Ruby"", a number one single in the United Kingdom. [PAR] When they were around eleven years old, Nick Hodgson, Nick Baines and Simon Rix met in the same class at St. Mary's School, Menston in Bradford. After leaving school, Rix and Baines left for university in 1996 whereas Hodgson remained in the Leeds area, meeting both Andrew White and Ricky Wilson. Hodgson, White and Wilson formed the band Runston Parva its name a deliberate misspelling of a small Yorkshire village called Ruston Parva. After Runston Parva failed to secure a record deal, the group would re-form as Parva upon the return of Rix and Baines from university. Parva's career would go beyond the boundaries of Leeds, and the band was able to obtain both a record and publishing deal. However, after Beggars Banquets closed the Mantra label, Parva were dropped and left desolate and without any direction after the release of an album and three singles. The band decided that they would aim for a longer term record deal and started afresh with new songs and a new name: Kaiser Chiefs.

These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin. [PAR] Led by the United States at the insistence of U.S. President Jimmy Carter, 65 countries boycotted the games because of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, though some athletes from some of the boycotting countries participated in the games under the Olympic Flag.

Six nations made their first Olympic appearance in 1980: Angola, Botswana, Jordan, Laos, Mozambique, and Seychelles. Cyprus made its debut at the Summer Olympics, but had appeared earlier at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. Sri Lanka competed for the first time under its new name (previously as Ceylon), Benin had competed previously as Dahomey and Zimbabwe competed for the first time under that name (previously as Rhodesia). [PAR] Although approximately half of the 24 countries that boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics (in protest against the IOC not expelling New Zealand who sanctioned a rugby tour of apartheid South Africa) participated in the Moscow Games, the 1980 Summer Olympics were disrupted by another, even larger, boycott led by the United States in protest at the 1979 Soviet war in Afghanistan. The Soviet invasion spurred Jimmy Carter to issue an ultimatum on January 20, 1980 that the US would boycott the Moscow Olympics if Soviet troops did not withdraw from Afghanistan within one month.  65 countries and regions invited did not take part in the 1980 Olympics. Many of these followed the United States' boycott initiative, while others cited economic reasons for not coming. Iran, under Ayatollah Khomeini hostile to both superpowers, boycotted when the Islamic Conference condemned the invasion.

As a form of protest against the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, fifteen countries marched in the Opening Ceremony with the Olympic Flag instead of their national flags, and the Olympic Flag and Olympic Hymn were used at medal ceremonies when athletes from these countries won medals.

[PAR] Ten to watch: meet Team GB's sporting superheroes [PAR] Read more [PAR] He has always maintained his innocence of doping and last year insisted in an interview with the Independent on Sunday’s Alan Hubbard that his sample had been contaminated. Yet whether you find his defence plausible or not – or similar arguments about tainted nutritional supplements a number of high-profile runners that year, including Merlene Ottey, Dieter Baumann, Mark Richardson and Dougie Walker, say they took in ignorance – it is impossible to overlook two facts: his urine sample was found to contain almost 100 times the legal limit of nandrolone metabolites and that the International Association of Athletics Federations overruled UK Athletics’ not guilty verdict and suspended Christie. [PAR] Suspicion, once raised, is inextinguishable. And because of what happened at the Seoul Games in 1988 – when he tested positive for pseudoephedrine after a 200m heat but was allowed to keep his 100m silver medal on an 11-10 vote by the disciplinary committee which gave him the benefit of the doubt that the substance had been unwittingly imbibed when drinking ginseng tea – his critics’ mistrust will never be assuaged. [PAR] But for all the conjecture, no one has the proof or right to revoke his Olympic gold nor any of the numerous other medals in European, Commonwealth and World competition. What cannot be denied either is that for anyone who witnessed his performance in Montjuïc that glorious August night in 1992, Christie’s triumph truly was a stunning Olympic moment. [PAR] A year before the Games, at the world championships in Tokyo, Christie finished fourth in the 100m final behind the double Olympic champion Carl Lewis , Leroy Burrell and Dennis Mitchell. Lewis broke the world record in 9.86sec, shaving 0.04 off the benchmark set by Burrell two months earlier and the men in second and third also established new personal bests. [PAR] Christie’s 9.92 was the fastest ever by a European but he was despondent when interviewed by the BBC’s Brendan Foster after the race, saying that he had reached his peak at the age of 31 and there were no faster times in his ageing legs. Foster had to spend a good two minutes of compelling television persuading the Great Britain team captain why retirement after running his best time would be a profligate folly.

[PAR] ""Camel"" is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like mammals in the family Camelidae: the two true camels and the four New World camelids: the llama, alpaca, guanaco, and vicuña of South America. [PAR] Biology [PAR] The average life expectancy of a camel is 40 to 50 years. A full-grown adult camel stands  at the shoulder and  at the hump. Camels can run at up to 65 km/h in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to 40 km/h. Bactrian camels weigh 300 to and dromedaries 300 to. [PAR] The male dromedary camel has in its throat an organ called a dulla, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue hanging out of the side of its mouth.  Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind.  The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session. Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position. [PAR] Ecological and behavioral adaptations [PAR] Camels do not directly store water in their humps as was once commonly believed. The humps are actually reservoirs of fatty tissue: concentrating body fat in their humps minimizes the insulating effect fat would have if distributed over the rest of their bodies, helping camels survive in hot climates.  When this tissue is metabolized, it yields more than one gram of water for every gram of fat processed. This fat metabolization, while releasing energy, causes water to evaporate from the lungs during respiration (as oxygen is required for the metabolic process): overall, there is a net decrease in water. [PAR] Camels have a series of physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand long periods of time without any external source of water. Unlike other mammals, their red blood cells are oval rather than circular in shape. This facilitates the flow of red blood cells during dehydration  and makes them better at withstanding high osmotic variation without rupturing when drinking large amounts of water: a 600 kg camel can drink 200 L of water in three minutes.  [PAR] Camels are able to withstand changes in body temperature and water consumption that would kill most other animals. Their temperature ranges from 34 °C at dawn and steadily increases to 40 °C by sunset, before they cool off at night again. Maintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for animals; to assist this, camels have a rete mirabile, a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain.  Camels rarely sweat, even when ambient temperatures reach 49 °C. Any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat; the heat of vaporization therefore comes from body heat rather than ambient heat. Camels can withstand losing 25% of their body weight to sweating, whereas most other mammals can withstand only about 12–14% dehydration before cardiac failure results from circulatory disturbance. [PAR] When the camel exhales, water vapor becomes trapped in their nostrils and is reabsorbed into the body as a means to conserve water.  Camels eating green herbage can ingest sufficient moisture in milder conditions to maintain their bodies' hydrated state without the need for drinking. [PAR] The camels' thick coats insulate them from the intense heat radiated from desert sand; a shorn",A rat can survive longer without water than a camel?,['true'],54a9650f8926496087325b479ec8b949,"[{'end': [819], 'start': [816]}]","∃x (Rat(x) ∧ SurviveWithoutWater(x, longer_than, Camel))"

Avocado fruits have greenish or yellowish flesh with a buttery consistency and a rich, nutty flavour. They are often eaten in salads, and in many parts of the world they are eaten as a dessert. Mashed avocado is the principal ingredient of guacamole, a characteristic sauce in Mexican cuisine. Avocados provide thiamin , riboflavin , and vitamin A , and in some varieties the flesh contains as much as 25 percent unsaturated oil. [PAR] Learn about the health benefits of avocados and preparing the fruits in a way that maximizes these. [PAR] © American Chemical Society (A Britannica Publishing Partner) [PAR] Avocado trees can be tall or spreading, and they have elliptic to egg-shaped leaves that are 10–30 cm (4–12 inches) in length. The small greenish flowers are borne in dense inflorescences and lack true petals. The flowers have nine stamens, arranged in three series, and a one-celled ovary. Interestingly, there are two types of avocado flowers, A and B, depending on the cultivar . These flowers are dichogamous (male and female parts mature separately), and each flower opens only twice. Type A flowers are functionally female in the morning, close at midday, and then reopen as functionally male in the afternoon of the following day. Type B flowers are functionally female in the afternoon, close in the evening, and then reopen the following morning as functionally male. When the two flower types are grown together, this temporal overlap of mature male and female parts encourages cross-pollination and, thus, greater fruit production. [PAR] Avocado (Persea americana).

Based on the book The Untouchables, the film stars Kevin Costner as government agent Eliot Ness. It also stars Sean Connery as Irish-American officer Jimmy Malone and Robert De Niro as gang leader Al Capone. The film follows Ness's autobiographical account of his efforts to bring Capone to justice during the Prohibition era.The Untouchables was released on June 3, 1987, and was critically acclaimed. Observers praised the film for its approach, as well as its direction. The film was also a financial success, grossing $76 million domestically. The Untouchables was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, of which Connery received one for Best Supporting Actor. [PAR] Plot [PAR] Edit Block [PAR] Prohibition in the United States leads to an organized crime wave involving bootlegged alcohol in the 1920s and early 1930s. The problem is most serious in Chicago, where gang leader Al Capone (Robert De Niro) has almost the whole city (even the Mayor of Chicago) under his control, and supplies low-quality liquor at high prices. Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is put in charge of leading the crusade against Capone and his empire. Ness's initial strategy is to conduct raids using a large squad of uniformed officers, but these fail due to corrupt cops who secretly tip Capone's men off. [PAR] Seeking a change of tactics, Ness has a chance encounter with incorruptible Irish officer Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery) and asks for his help. Malone advises Ness to pick men who have never come under Capone's influence by recruiting directly from the police academy. Italian American trainee George Stone, formerly Giuseppe Petri (Andy García), is enlisted due to his superior marksmanship and intelligence under pressure. Joined by accountant Oscar Wallace, a character based on Frank J. Wilson (Charles Martin Smith), assigned to Ness from Washington, he has built an incorruptible team that can stand up to Capone. [PAR] Their first raid takes place in a post office where illegal liquor is stored. Malone and most of the police know where the alcohol is and leave it alone because no one wants to provoke Capone and his gang. As the four pick up steam and become noted by the press, Wallace informs Ness that Capone has not filed an income tax return in four years; therefore, they can try Capone for tax evasion, if nothing else. Ness is visited by an alderman who tries to bribe him into dropping the investigation. Ness angrily rejects the bribe and throws him out, but not before the alderman mockingly refers to the team as “untouchable” and says that Capone can have anyone killed who gets in his way. [PAR] Capone's chief assassin Frank Nitti (Billy Drago) shows up outside Ness' house and threatens his family. Realizing that his wife and daughter are now targets, Ness has them moved to a safer place, then takes the team to the Canada – United States border for a raid on an incoming liquor shipment. In an ensuing firefight Ness chases one of the gangsters into an empty house and traps him inside. The man pulls a gun on Ness, but is shot in the chest with a shotgun. Malone captures one of Capone’s bookkeepers, George (Brad Sullivan).",Who played Irish-American cop Jim Malone in the 1987 film The Untouchables?,['sean connery'],b29356db59fe4383aa58af4adc4dbe81,"[{'end': [272, 1200, 2505], 'start': [261, 1189, 2494]}]","∃x Played(x, ""Jim Malone"", ""The Untouchables"", 1987)"

And he should be brainy – he should have little grey cells of the mind. [PAR] Agatha Christie - An Autobiography [PAR] About Hercule Poirot [PAR] The Beginning [PAR] Hercule Poirot came into existence during World War I. Agatha Christie was working as a VAD in Torquay, and encountered on a daily basis Belgian refugees arriving in England from the continent. Searching for a detective for her first novel, she set upon the idea of creating a Belgian detective who had been ""a former shining light of the Belgian police force"", before being forced out of his country. [PAR] Christie completed The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1916, but it wasn’t published until four years later. In the novel, Poirot is called upon by his old friend Lieutenant Hastings, who would come to be the Watson to Poirot's Holmes. Christie later wrote that Poirot's introduction to detective fiction was not at all how he himself would have liked. ""Hercule Poirot first,"" he would have said, ""and then a plot to display his remarkable talents to their best advantage."" [PAR] A Great Man [PAR] Poirot would be the first to call himself a great man - he has never been known for his modesty - but with such success in his career, it is difficult to argue with him. He finishes each case with a dramatic dénouement, satisfying his own ego and confirming to all that he is truly ""the greatest mind in Europe."" His love of elegance, beauty, and precision, as well as his eccentric mannerisms are often ridiculed by the local bumbling policemen, but it is always Poirot who has the last word. [PAR] My name is Hercule Poirot, and I am probably the greatest detective in the world. [PAR] Hercule Poirot, The Mystery of the Blue Train [PAR] Agatha Christie never imagined how popular Poirot would become, nor how many stories she would write about him. He stars in 33 novels and 54 short stories, including some of Christie's most successful such as Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile . [PAR] Poirot and Christie [PAR] One of Christie’s later regrets was that Hercule Poirot began his literary life too mature: ""the result is that my fictional detective is well over a hundred by now."" And it is no secret that character and author did not always see eye to eye. [PAR] “There are moments when I have felt: ‘Why-why-why did I ever invent this detestable, bombastic, tiresome little creature?’…. But now, I must confess it, Hercule Poirot has won. A reluctant affection has sprung up for him…” Agatha Christie’s introduction to the serialisation of Appointment With Death in the Daily Mail, 1938. [PAR] Christie grew tired of Poirot's idiosyncrasies so much so that she wrote Curtain: Poirot's Last Case in the 1940s. It was locked in a safe until 1974 when it was finally published, earning Poirot a well-deserved obituary in The New York Times; he is the only fictional character to have received such an honour. [PAR] Playing Poirot [PAR] The first actor to take on the role of the little Belgian was Charles Laughton in 1928 in the theatrical debut of Alibi. Austin Trevor was the first Poirot on screen in 1931, and went on to star in three films. There was Tony Randall in 1965 and Academy Award nominee Albert Finney in the all-star classic Murder on the Orient Express in 1974.

"[DOC] [TLE] Barbarella (film) - Duran Duran Wiki - WikiaBarbarella (film) | Duran Duran Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia [PAR] Edit [PAR] Set in the 40th century, Barbarella follows the adventures of its title character played by Jane Fonda. In the film, Barbarella is assigned by the President of Earth to retrieve Doctor Durand Durand from the planet So Go in order to save the earth. Beyond this premise, the plot is very loose, serving mostly as an excuse for Barbarella to end up in erotic situations. On her quest to find Durand Durand, Barbarella is seduced by a human resident of SoGo, who introduces her to penetrative intercourse (civilized people of Barbarella's society find sexual release through pharmaceuticals), seduces an angel named Pygar, and overloads a torture device (called the Excessive Machine) which kills through sexual pleasure. [PAR] Style [PAR] Edit [PAR] Barbarella is famous for a sequence in which the title character, played by Jane Fonda, undresses in zero gravity during the opening credits. [PAR] The whole film is played in a tongue-in-cheek manner;especially when it comes to the frequent (but not explicit) sex scenes. The most controversial of those scenes involves Barbarella being tortured by the use of a piano-like instrument that delivers sexual pleasure in doses that can be lethal, although Barbarella survives the ordeal and is visibly disappointed when it is discovered she has overloaded the machine. [PAR] The film was simultaneously shot in French and English. Some characters' lines were performed by the same actors in both languages; others were not: [PAR] In the French version, Fonda performs her own lines in French. [PAR] Marcel Marceau's lines are dubbed into English. [PAR] De Laurentiis returned to camp science fiction (but with far less erotica) with 1980s Flash Gordon. [PAR] Cast [PAR] Ugo Tognazzi as Mark Hand [PAR] Reception and influences [PAR] Edit [PAR] The film was both a box office and critical failure on its release. Variety 's review stated that ""Despite a certain amount of production dash and polish and a few silly-funny lines of dialogue, Barbarella isn't very much of a film. Based on what has been called an adult comic strip, the Dino De Laurentiis production is flawed with a cast that is not particularly adept at comedy, a flat script, and direction which can't get this beached whale afloat."" Another major critic at the time claimed the film was a ""mix of poor special effects and the Marquis de Sade .""However, it has gained a cult following since its re-release in 1977 on home video, and has had considerable influence on pop and film culture in the decades following its original release. Jane Fonda has subsequently lamented the fact that she turned down starring roles in two major hit films, Bonnie and Clyde and Rosemary's Baby to stay in France and star in Barbarella, which was being directed by her then husband Roger Vadim. [PAR] Sound track [PAR] Edit [PAR] The film's score was also popular and obtained a cult following. The music was composed by Bob Crewe and Charles Fox . During his first European tour in 1967 Frank Zappa flew from Copenhagen to Italy to meet Vadim and Fonda in order to discuss the possibility of him composing the music for the film. It never happened, but Frank Zappa remained faithful to his love for sci-fi, and composed several tributes to the genre. [PAR] Music [PAR] Edit [PAR] In the world of comics , the manga artists collectively known as CLAMP parodied Barbarella in one chapter of their Miyuki-chan in Wonderland , the chapter titled TV no Kuni no Miyuki-chan (Miyuki-chan in TV Land) shows several of the characters (including some female versions) trying to seduce the main character. The manga contains heavy lesbian overtones. [PAR] In 2008 the indie pop singer Lights made a Barbarella-themed music video for her song ""Drive My Soul"".

[PAR] One of the most commonly used animal ingredients in cosmetics is lanolin. It’s most frequently found in lotions and lipsticks – anything that needs to be moisturizing. What exactly is it that you’re putting on your skin with these products? [PAR] Lanolin is a waxy yellow substance that is secreted by the glands of wool bearing mammals. Typically, this means from sheep. It’s also called wool wax or wool grease. Just like lactoferrin , once you find out what it is, odds are you won’t want it on your skin. It’s what gives sheep their waterproof winter coat and protects them from the elements. This is why it’s also used in products that prevent metal from rusting. [PAR] Many people believe that lanolin is a cruelty free item that comes from the wool of sheep as they are shorn. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The majority if the time, the sheep have been slaughtered for their meat and the lanolin is a by product of this meat industry. As with sheep that are bred for their wool supply, the end goal is to slaughter the animals for their meat. [PAR] While lanolin may help make your skin feel smooth, do you really want to put something on your skin that’s also used to prevent metal from rusting? An even more important question – do you really want animals to go to slaughter for you to use these moisturizers? [PAR] There are many great vegan options out there that don’t contain animal ingredients and have not been tested on animals. There are products from Earthly Body , Nature’s Gate , and Lush all have a variety of moisturizers that are cruelty free, vegan and work great!

The FDA has approved lanolin for use in many products, such as cosmetics, lip balm and nipple cream, but is lanolin really safe for you – and more importantly, for your baby? [PAR] What is Lanolin? [PAR] Lanolin is a waxy substance that coats a sheep’s fur, keeping it moist and protecting its skin. After a sheep has been shorn, a waxy substance called sebum is left on the fur, which comes from the animal’s sebaceous glands – just like human skin produces oil – and is affected by hormone production. While lanolin contains sebum, according to “ The Scouring Post ” by Elaine Benfatto, lanolin can also contain sweat, dirt, dust, pollen, fecal matter and more. In addition, different sheep breeds create different consistencies and make up of lanolin. Lanolin must first be purified before it can be used in any products to remove all the garbage and that can be a challenge. This refining process varies greatly between different companies, the chemicals used and the degree of purity in the process. After refinement, lanolin is used in a number of skin care and beauty products for consumer and in hospitals for wound care, but it’s also one of the most common ingredients for nipple cream, which provides relief from cracked and sore nipples to breastfeeding moms. [PAR] GMOs in Your Lanolin [PAR] While refining can be complicated and difficult, the real problem with lanolin is its toxic makeup. Sheep that are conventionally farmed in the U.S. for wool are typically not raised organic. According to the American Sheep Industry Association document, “ Fast Facts about Sheep Ecology  (PDF),” sheep eat a range of foods and much of their feed is made of alfalfa, which is considered “grass” and does contain GMOs.

Tom is the character who shows the most development, experiencing what Peter Lisca calls an ""education of the heart."" This education, gained through experience, intuition, and the teachings of Jim Casy, best exemplifies the moral journey from self to community, from ""I"" to ""we."" Tom moves from caring only for himself to a familial loyalty to seeing the entire world as his family. [PAR] Tom is kind and often merciful, yet quick to anger and fiercely independent. As a man of action, he embodies one of the novel's main philosophical strands, pragmatism, standing in contrast to the idealistic and talkative Jim Casy. While Casy is predominantly an observer and commentator on the human condition, Tom's acts of humanity are subconscious, his insights and compassion intuitive. Tom is concerned with the practical aspects of his life as they relate to the here and now, not the moral or ideological circumstances surrounding his actions. In this sense, Tom and Casy follow inverted paths in the development of their characters. After Casy has the opportunity to witness his beliefs acted out by the jail inmates, he moves from a position of observation and contemplation to one of action. Tom's social role moves in the opposite direction, from one of action to one of reflection. Not until Tom stops moving and reacting does he have the opportunity to absorb Casy's ideas. When he does so, however, Tom's development comes full-circle as he pledges to return to continue the actions begun by Casy.[DOC] [TLE] The Grapes of Wrath: The Grapes of Wrath Character List ...The Grapes of Wrath: The Grapes of Wrath Character List | Book Summary & Study Guide | CliffsNotes [PAR]    Bookmark this page    Manage My Reading List [PAR] Tom Joad The novel's main character and second Joad son.

The Story: [PAR] Imagine the skyline of a modern city if the elevator did not exist.      Buildings would be limited to five or six stories. Most of the architecture      of the 20th and 21st century would be impossible. Office towers, hotels and      high-rise apartments would hardly stand in their present form. [PAR] The need for vertical transport is as old as      civilization. Over the centuries, mankind has employed ingenious forms of      lifting. The earliest lifts used man, animal and water power to raise the      load. Lifting devices relied on these basic forms of power from the early      agricultural societies until the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. [PAR] From ancient times through the         Middle Ages, and into the 13th century, man or animal power was the driving force behind         hoisting devices. In ancient Greece, Archimedes developed an improved      lifting device operated by ropes and pulleys, in which the hoisting ropes      were coiled around a winding drum by a capstan and levers. By A.D. 80,      gladiators and wild animals rode crude elevators up to the arena level of      the Roman Coliseum. [PAR] Medieval records contain numerous drawings of hoists lifting men and      supplies to isolated locations. Among the most famous is the hoist at the      monastery of St. Barlaam in Greece. The monastery stood on a pinnacle      approximately (200 ft) above the ground. Its hoist, which employed a basket      or cargo net, was the only means up or down. [PAR] The first elevator designed for a      passemger was built in 1743 for King Louis XV at his palace in         France. The one-person contraption went up only one floor, from the first to the second.         Known as the ""Flying Chair,"" it was on the outside of the building, and was         entered by the king via his balcony. The mechanism consisted of a carefully balanced         arrangement of weights and pulleys hanging inside a chimney. Men stationed inside the         chimney then raised or lowered the Flying Chair at the king's command.  [PAR] By 1850 steam and hydraulic elevators had been introduced,         but it was in 1852 that the landmark event in elevator history occurred: the invention of         the world's first safety elevator by Elisha Graves Otis. The first passenger elevator was installed         by Otis in New York in 1857. After Otis' death in 1861, his sons, Charles and Norton,         built on his heritage, creating Otis Brothers & Co. in 1867.

[PAR] Related Posts: [PAR] The Dakota Apartments [PAR]   [PAR] After Lennon’s murder (outside of The Dakota) his widow, Yoko Ono, worked with landscape architect Bruce Kelly and the Central Park Conservancy to create a quiet, peaceful and meditative spot in honor of her late husband.  The area is shaded by elm trees and is punctuated by outcroppings of Manhattan schist.  Yoko Ono, in addition to helping with the plans, donated over a million dollars for the landscaping and maintenance of the area.

[PAR] Gary dos Santos was known for many years as The Mayor of Strawberry Fields.  For almost twenty years he decorated the mosaic daily, usually using flowers to form a peace symbol.  His income came from visitor’s tips, and he greeted people with a monologue about who he was and some information on John Lennon.  He was often accompanied by both his girlfriend and his dog, Mary Jane.  Dos Santos passed away on November 25th, 2013, and while many musicians gather at the memorial to play and entertain visitors, no one has become a permanent fixture the way Dos Santos was.

"[DOC] [TLE] absolute zero | temperature | Britannica.comabsolute zero | temperature | Britannica.com [PAR] Absolute zero [PAR] physical science [PAR] Absolute zero, temperature at which a thermodynamic system has the lowest energy. It corresponds to −273.15 °C on the Celsius temperature scale and to −459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit temperature scale . [PAR] The notion that there is an ultimately lowest temperature was suggested by the behaviour of gases at low pressures: it was noted that gases seem to contract indefinitely as temperature decreases. It appeared that an “ ideal gas ” at constant pressure would reach zero volume at what is now called the absolute zero of temperature. Any real gas actually condenses to a liquid or a solid at some temperature higher than absolute zero; therefore, the ideal gas law is only an approximation to real gas behaviour. As such, however, it is extremely useful. [PAR] The concept of absolute zero as a limiting temperature has many thermodynamic consequences. For example, all molecular motion does not cease at absolute zero (molecules vibrate with what is called zero-point energy ), but no energy from molecular motion (that is, heat energy) is available for transfer to other systems, and it is therefore correct to say that the energy at absolute zero is minimal. [PAR] Any temperature scale having absolute zero for its zero point is termed an absolute temperature scale or a thermodynamic scale. In the International System of Units , the Kelvin (K) scale is the standard for all scientific temperature measurements. Its fundamental unit, the kelvin, is identical in size to the Celsius degree and is defined as 1/273.16 of the “triple point” of pure water (0.01 °C [32.02 °F])—i.e., the temperature at which the liquid, solid, and gaseous forms of the substance can be maintained simultaneously. The interval between this triple point and absolute zero comprises 273.16 kelvins. The lowest temperature achieved in experiments has been 50 picokelvin (pK; 1 pK = 10−12 K).

His mother, born in Indiana, was from a Swedish family, and his father was from Texas. Val studied at Hollywood's Professional's School and, in his teens, entered Juilliard's drama program. His professional acting career began on stage, and he still participates in theater; he played Hamlet at the 1988 Colorado Shakespeare Festival. His film debut was in the 1984 spoof Top Secret! (1984), wherein he starred as blond rock idol Nick Rivers. He was in a number of films throughout the 1980s, including the 1986 smash Top Gun (1986). Despite his obvious talent and range, it wasn't until his astonishingly believable performance as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone 's The Doors (1991) that the world sat up and took notice.

It connects the Indian Ocean on the east with the Atlantic Ocean on the west of the land. Part of the river forms the border between South Africa and Namibia. [PAR] The Orange River transverses such a great distance that it crosses into many regions. Depending on the region, it is often called a different name, like the Gariep River.[DOC] [TLE] The Longest River in South Africa – - Where2StayThe Longest River in South Africa – -  Where2Stay [PAR] The Longest River in South Africa [PAR] Adventure March 22nd, 2012 [PAR] The longest river in South Africa is the Orange River which starts off life in the Drakensberg Mountains and works its way westwards to Alexander Bay and then onto the west coast of South Africa. The Orange River is some 2,200km in length considerably longer than other well-known rivers here such as the Vaal River (1,120km) and the Tugela River (502km). [PAR] The Orange River also feeds water to the Gariep Dam â€“ the largest dam in South Africa. This huge dam is an important source of electricity able to create 360MW of electricity at its maximum output. [PAR] The river is very popular with canoeists particularly during the rainy months of March and April when the river is at its peak creating decent and plentiful rapids. Many people come here to take part in canoe expeditions paddling down the Orange River and stopping overnight along the way. For someone looking for adventure on their holiday and to experience the scenery along the river this is a true outdoor eco-experience. A number of companies offer canoeing and kayaking trips lasting just 1 day to several days. [PAR] The temperatures along the river from November to March can reach up over 40 degrees Celsius with the cooler months being April to October. The months of June to August offer slightly more pleasant temperatures of around 20 degrees during the day but obviously cooler at night. [PAR] One of the leading specialists in providing trips on the Orange River is Felix Unite who offer weekend getaways to 6 day river trips. [PAR] Another popular past-time on the Orange River is fly-fishing at the Richtersveld National Park. The best times of year for fly-fishing are August to December, May to July and mid-December to April when the river is at its highest. Fly-fishing is done on a eco-friendly catch-and-release basis but is great fun.

It is used to either refer to the study of bird eggs, or it can be used to describe the collecting of bird eggs. Even though the name is the same, the impact on bird life and ecosystems is vastly different. Studying bird eggs allows scientists and conservationists to understand the breeding habits of various birds and their nests. Collecting bird eggs almost led to the extinction of many bird species, as it had become a popular hobby that is now illegal in most countries. [PAR] While practicing oology as a science, it was discovered that birds that nest and lay their eggs in bushes generally lay speckled eggs, as opposed to birds that have their nests on the ground and lay unspotted white eggs. It was also found that birds that choose trees as the ideal nesting spot have either greenish colored or blue eggs that can either be unspotted or spotted. This gives conservationists great insight into birds, their nests, amount of eggs laid and general nesting habitats of various bird species. [PAR] Collecting eggs was seen as a hobby, much like collecting stamps, during the nineteenth and twentieth century. This led to a rapid decline in birds and near extinction of some. Collectors did not just remove one egg from the nest, but the entire clutch of eggs. The rarer the bird, the more valuable their eggs became, and this endangered them even more. After the eggs were collected, they would be blown out, their contents removed, to prevent the rotting of the eggs. Egg collectors would then write a date on the egg, identify the specie and frame the eggs. It is for this reason that oology as a hobby has become illegal and in certain countries, collectors can face imprisonment. [PAR] In Britain, an overzealous oologist named Colin Watson stole the eggs out the nests of very rare and protected bird species and was fined numerous times for collecting eggs. He fell to his death from a tree in 2006, and it was revealed that he had a collection of more than two thousand eggs in his possession. Gregory Wheal, also from Britain was jailed for six months for being in possession of raven and peregrine falcon eggs, and fellow Brit, Richard Pearson had more than seven thousand seven hundred eggs, which are now protected by the law, and his detailed notes and confession described a fifteen year period of stealing eggs. Fortunately, the oology hobby became less popular and oology is now used to introduce new captive breeding methods, incubation and to save endangered species from extinction.[DOC] [TLE] Oh, Oology! | Inside Adams: Science, Technology & BusinessOh, Oology! | Inside Adams: Science, Technology & Business [PAR] by Jennifer Harbster [PAR] Plate IX from Bendire’s Life Histories of North American, 1892 (Fig. 1, 2, 3- Ferrugionous rough-legged hawk; Fig. 3 & 5- golden eagle; Fig. 6,8,& 9- Gyrfalcon, Fig. 7 Bald Eagle) [PAR] Here are two words",Oology is the study of what?,['eggs'],ca3e1af4a7994a66a243eb2ee895d326,"[{'end': [1091, 1921, 1330, 3209, 3346, 3428, 2241, 2595, 1271, 3552, 1572, 2987, 3090, 161, 2486, 1129, 953, 458, 1444, 2786, 1797, 892, 2037, 2536, 2695, 1835, 2160], 'start': [1088, 1918, 1327, 3206, 3343, 3425, 2238, 2592, 1268, 3549, 1569, 2984, 3087, 158, 2483, 1126, 950, 455, 1441, 2783, 1794, 889, 2034, 2533, 2692, 1832, 2157]}]","∃x Study(x, Oology)"

"[DOC] [TLE] The SmurfsThe Smurfs (French: Les Schtroumpfs; Dutch: De Smurfen) is a Belgian comic franchise centered on a fictional colony of small blue humanoids who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest. The Smurfs was first created and introduced as a series of comic characters by the Belgian comics artist Peyo (pen name of Pierre Culliford) in 1958, where they were known as Les Schtroumpfs. There are more than one hundred Smurf characters, and their names are based on adjectives that emphasize their characteristics, such as ""Jokey Smurf"", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow smurfs. ""Smurfette"" was the first female Smurf to be introduced in the series. The Smurfs wear Phrygian caps, which came to represent freedom during the modern era. [PAR] The word “Smurf” is the original Dutch translation of the French ""Schtroumpf"", which, according to Peyo, is a word invented during a meal with fellow cartoonist André Franquin, when he could not remember the word salt. [PAR] The Smurfs franchise began as a comic and expanded into advertising, films, TV series, ice capades, video games, theme parks, and dolls. [PAR] Origin [PAR] At the time he came up with the idea for the Smurfs, Peyo was the creator, artist, and writer of the Franco-Belgian comics series titled Johan et Pirlouit (translated to English as Johan and Peewit), set in Europe during the Middle Ages and including elements of sword-and-sorcery. Johan serves as a brave young page to the king, and Pirlouit (pronounced Peer-loo-ee) functions as his faithful, if boastful and cheating, midget sidekick.  [PAR] In 1958, Spirou magazine started to publish the Johan et Pirlouit story La Flûte à six trous (""The Flute with Six Holes""). The adventure involved them recovering a magic flute, which required some sorcery by the wizard Homnibus. In this manner, they met a tiny, blue-skinned humanoid in white clothing called a ""Schtroumpf"", followed by his numerous peers who looked just like him, with an elderly leader who wore red clothing and had a white beard. Their first full appearance was published in Spirou on October 23, 1958.  The characters proved to be a huge success, and the first independent Smurf stories appeared in Spirou in 1959, together with the first merchandising. The Smurfs shared more adventures with Johan and Pirlouit, got their own series and all subsequent publications of the original story were retitled La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs (also the title of the movie version of the story). [PAR] Schtroumpf is pronounced like the German word ""Strumpf"" meaning ""sock"". However, according to Peyo, original author of the original Smurfs comic strip, the original term and the accompanying language of the Smurfs came during a meal he was having with his colleague and friend André Franquin at the Belgian Coast. Having momentarily forgotten the word ""salt"", Peyo asked him (in French) to pass the schtroumpf. Franquin jokingly replied: ""Here's the Schtroumpf—when you are done schtroumpfing, schtroumpf it back..."" and the two spent the rest of that weekend speaking in ""schtroumpf language"". The name was later translated into Dutch as Smurf, which was adopted in English. [PAR] With the commercial success of the Smurfs came the merchandising empire of Smurf miniatures, models, games, and toys. Entire collecting clubs have devoted themselves to collecting PVC Smurfs and Smurf merchandise. [PAR] Smurfs universe [PAR] Smurfs [PAR] The storylines tend to be simple tales of bold adventure. The cast has a simple structure as well: almost all the characters look essentially alike—mostly male (a few female Smurfs have appeared: Smurfette, Sassette, and Nanny Smurf), short (three apples high),  with blue skin, white trousers with a hole for their short tails, white hat in the style of a Phrygian cap, and sometimes some additional accessory that identifies a personality (for example, ""Handy Smurf"" wears overalls instead of the standard trousers, a brimmed hat, and a pencil above his ear).

OPEC is made up of eleven developing countries - Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. These countries rely on oil revenues as their main source of income. All these countries export oil substantially. [PAR] The organization aims at coordinating and unifying petroleum policies of its member countries. OPEC also aims at stabilizing prices in the international oil markets. It wants to secure a steady income to the producing countries. OPEC has not succeeded always in putting a stabilizing influence on the market. Oil revenues are vital for the economic development of these nations. [PAR] The Representatives of OPEC Member Countries (Heads of Delegation) get together at the OPEC Conference to co-ordinate and unify petroleum policies.

[PAR] There is one point on the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales where the temperatures in degrees are equal. This is -40 °C and -40 °F. If you can't remember the number, there is a simple algebraic method to find the answer. [PAR] Answer: Rather than converting one temperature to another (not helpful because it assumes you already know the answer), you set degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit equal to each other using the conversion formula between the two temperature scales: [PAR] °F = (°C * 9/5) + 32 [PAR] °C = (°F - 32) * 5/9 [PAR] It does not matter which equation you use.

[PAR] What is the temperature at which Fahrenheit and Celsius thermometer readings are equal? [PAR] Asked by: Hamid A. Khan [PAR] Answer [PAR] The temperature at which Fahrenheit and Celsius thermometer readings are equal is: - 40 degrees. [PAR] Well if you look at the conversion formulas for Celsius to Fahrenheit, or that of Fahrenheit  to Celsius, you can manipulate it mathematically to answer this question. [PAR] The conversion formula reads: [PAR] T(F) = T(C) x 9/5  +  32 [PAR] this means that the temperature of Fahrenheit equals the temperature of Celsius multiplied  by nine / fifths, plus 32 degrees. [PAR] If the temperatures are the same then the two 'T's' in the formula should represent the  same temperature. [PAR] So, [PAR] t = t x 9/5 + 32 [PAR] minus the nine fifths of t from each side to move it to the left of the equation.   this leaves: [PAR] t - 9t/5 = 32 ------>  this leaves: - 4t/5 = 32 [PAR] so then you multiply each side by - 5/4 to solve for t, and you get t = - 40 degrees!

The degree Celsius (°C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. Before being renamed to honour Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called centigrade, from the Latin centum, which means 100, and gradus, which means steps.

"[DOC] [TLE] Homer SimpsonHomer Jay Simpson is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the American animated television series The Simpsons as the patriarch of the eponymous family. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in The Tracey Ullman Show short ""Good Night"" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpson family got their own series on Fox that debuted December 17, 1989. [PAR] Homer and his wife Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is essentially a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences. [PAR] In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of Walter Matthau; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons – including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books – and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt ""D'oh!"", has been included in The New Oxford Dictionary of English since 1998 and the Oxford English Dictionary since 2001. [PAR] Homer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television. The British newspaper The Sunday Times described him as ""the greatest comic creation of [modern] time"". He was named the greatest character ""of the last 20 years"" in 2010 by Entertainment Weekly, was ranked the second greatest cartoon character by TV Guide, behind Bugs Bunny, and was voted the greatest television character of all time by Channel 4 viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance and a special-achievement Annie Award. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. [PAR] Role in The Simpsons [PAR] Homer is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. He is the son of Mona and Abraham ""Grampa"" Simpson. Homer held over 188 different jobs in the first 400 episodes of The Simpsons. In most episodes, he works as the Nuclear Safety Inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position he has held since ""Homer's Odyssey"", the third episode of the series.  At the plant, Homer is often ignored and completely forgotten by his boss Mr. Burns, and constantly falls asleep and neglects his duties. Matt Groening has stated that he decided to have Homer work at the power plant because of the potential for Homer to wreak havoc.  Each of his other jobs has lasted only one episode. In the first half of the series, the writers developed an explanation about how he got fired from the plant and was then rehired in every episode. In later episodes, he often began a new job on impulse, without any mention of his regular employment.  [PAR] The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters never physically age, and, as such, the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. Nevertheless, in several episodes, events in Homer's life have been linked to specific time periods. ""Mother Simpson"" (season seven, 1995) depicts Homer's mother, Mona, as a radical who went into hiding in 1969 following a run-in with the law; ""The Way We",Where does Homer Simpson work?,"['springfield nuclear power plant', 'springfield nuclear', 'sector 7g']",c277c796a91d41808554ae4362ed9af8,"[{'end': [2967, 969], 'start': [2937, 939]}, {'end': [2955, 957], 'start': [2937, 939]}]","∃x Works(x, Homer_Simpson)"

"[DOC] [TLE] John Christie of Rillington Place | The Library Time MachineJohn Christie of Rillington Place | The Library Time Machine [PAR] The Library Time Machine [PAR] By Dave Walker [PAR] We have an author event at Kensington Central Library on November 8th. Crime historian Jonathan Oates will be talking about his new book (published October 18th) John Christie of Rillington Place: Biography of a serial killer. This is a definitive account of the Christie murders based on new research. I asked Jonathan to  write something about the case for the blog and he sent me this piece about some of the locations associated with the murders: [PAR] Most people have heard of John Christie of 10 Rillington Place, Notting Hill and perhaps have seen the film, made in 1970 and starring Richard Attenborough as Christie and John Hurt as Timothy Evans. The actual street itself is long gone (renamed as Ruston Close in 1954 and demolished in the 1970s; number 10 in October 1970), but there are a number of buildings associated with the case which still stand, though are perhaps less well known and the following is a brief gazetteer. [PAR] [10 Rillngton Place: last house on the left] [PAR] Below is the Kensington Park Hotel, standing on the corner of Ladbroke Grove and Lancaster Road and the pub which Timothy Evans was fond of drinking in. Unlike many pubs it does not sell food, does not have ‘music’ and does not have a carpet; contrast this to a rather more upmarket and touristy pub on Praed Street near Paddington which was a haunt of Kathleen Maloney, Christie’s fourth victim. Middle class visitors to the KPH may well find themselves out of place. [PAR] The public library opposite the pub was the one visited by Ethel Christie on the evening of 8 November, the same day that fellow resident of number ten, Beryl Evans, was strangled. Christie himself had a library card so presumably also visited there. In Pentonville Prison it was said that he mainly read thrillers and that despite his airs, wasn’t much of a scholar, according to a fellow inmate. [PAR] The nearby Oxford Gardens is also of importance in the case. Firstly, because at number 41 there lived, for a few months of 1943, Ruth Fuerst, a young Austrian woman who became Christie’s first victim. Less well known is that Christie and his wife lived at number 23 in 1936, whilst Christie was employed as foreman at the Commodore Cinema in Hammersmith. This is the only house in London where Christie lived and which still stands. As with many houses in Notting Hill at this time, it was shared with other families. [PAR] Cambridge Gardens, number 108a was the home of the Thorley family from at least 1945-1947. Beryl Thorley, later Beryl Evans, lived there with her parents and brother, Basil. When her mother died, the family broke up, with her father going to Brighton, she marrying Timothy Evans in 1947 and her brother living elsewhere. Basil was convinced that his sister was murdered by her husband, who said to him, ‘I’m sorry, Baz’. [PAR] Number 319 Portobello Road was the address of second hand furniture dealer Robert Hookway who bought the furniture of both Timothy Evans and John Christie before the two left the district.  Dr Matthew Odess, Christie’s GP, resided at 30 Colville Square. [PAR] Many of the other buildings involved in the case are long gone. The Royalty Cinema, which employed Basil Thorley and which was patronised by the Evanses, has been demolished; it was on 105 Lancaster Road. Others include the house that the Evanses lived in, in St. Mark’s Road, number eleven and another house briefly resided in by the Christies in 1936; 172 Clarendon Road.

Their three children are the actor Jared Harris, the actor Jamie Harris, and the director Damian Harris. Harris and Rees-Willams divorced in 1969, and then Elizabeth married another well-known actor, Sir Rex Harrison. Harris’ second marriage was to the American actress Ann Turkel, who was 16 years younger than he, and this marriage also ended in a divorce.Despite his divorces, Harris was a member of the Roman Catholic Knights of Malta, and was also dubbed a knight by the Queen of Denmark in 1985. Harris was a life long friend of actor Peter O’Toole. Harris died of Hodgkin’s disease on 25 October 2002, aged 72, two and a half weeks before the American premiere of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. He was replaced as Dumbledore by the Irish-born actor Sir Michael Gambon. For years, whenever he was in London, Harris resided at the Savoy Hotel.

The kidneys are a pair of organs in the body that perform the function of osmoregulation , blood filtration, and elimination of wastes in the form of urine . Some of the common problems of the kidneys are acute kidney failures associated with the lack of blood flow to the kidneys, direct damage to the kidneys, and blockage of urine from the kidneys. Another is the chronic kidney disease (CKD) that is commonly caused by types 1 and 2 diabetes and by high blood pressure. Other causes of CKD include immune system conditions (e.g. lupus, AIDS, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C), urinary tract infections (pyelonephritis), inflammation of glomeruli, polycystic kidney disease, congenital defecs, and long-term medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.1 Nephrology is also concerned with the diagnosis of these kidney problems and the appropriate medical care and treatments (e.g. renal replacement therapy such as dialysis and renal transplant).

This medical field is comprised of professionals known as nephrologists or renal physicians. These medical doctors are entirely in charge of kidney care and kidney performance. [PAR] Nephrologists or renal physicians are in some cases referred to as kidney doctors. This medical title has been derived from a Greek word known as ‘nephros’ which is translated to kidneys or renal and the term ‘ologist’ which is anyone undertaking a study. Nephrologists begin with the study of general medicine prior to focusing on a specialty of conditions related to the kidneys. [PAR] The most common kidney related ailments treated through application of nephrology knowledge include: acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney stones, polycystic kidney disease (PKD), hematuria, hypertension and high blood pressure. Nephrology also involves renal replacement therapy that may in some cases have surgical procedures such as kidney transplant and dialysis. [PAR] The practice of nephrology is concerned with the diagnosis of different kidney conditions and their treatment. Most diseases that affect the kidney are not restricted to affecting the vital organ only; other parts and organs may also experience symptoms of the complication. Therefore in most cases nephrology involve keen special care of the patient. [PAR] Physicians in the field of nephrology often are categorized further into specialized groups depending on the diagnosis and condition of the patient. For example it is possible to have nephrologists who focus on acid-base, fluid, and electrolyte disorders such as hypokalemia or who specialize in chronic kidney disease like uremia.

Prior to starting his solo career, he was the principal songwriter, lead singer and bassist for the rock band The Police. Throughout his career, Sting has incorporated distinct elements of jazz, reggae, classical, New Age, and worldbeat into his music. As a solo musician and member of The Police, Sting has received sixteen Grammy Awards; receiving his first Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1981, three Brit Awards (including Best British Male in 1994), a Golden Globe, an Emmy Award, and several Oscar nominations for Best Original Song. He is a member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. [PAR] Born Gordon Matthew Sumner, he is the eldest of four children. Sumner was raised in the Roman Catholic tradition, due to the influence of his paternal grandmother, who was from an Irish family.  He attended St Cuthbert's Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne, and then the University of Warwick, but did not graduate. During this time, he often sneaked into nightclubs like the Club-a-Go-Go. Here he saw acts like Jack Bruce and Jimi Hendrix, who would later influence his music. After jobs as a bus conductor, a construction labourer, and a tax officer, he attended Northern Counties Teachers' Training College, which later became part of Northumbria University, from 1971 to 1974. He then worked as a teacher at St Paul's First School in Cramlington for two years. [PAR] From an early age, Sumner knew that he wanted to be a musician. His first music gigs were wherever he could get a job, performing evenings, weekends, and during vacations from college and teaching. He played with local jazz bands such as the Phoenix Jazzmen, the Newcastle Big Band, and Last Exit. [PAR] He gained his nickname while with the Phoenix Jazzmen. He once performed wearing a black and yellow jersey with hooped stripes that bandleader Gordon Solomon had noted made him look like a bumblebee; thus Sumner became ""Sting"". [PAR] In January 1977, Sting moved from Newcastle to London, and soon thereafter he joined Stewart Copeland and Henry Padovani (who was very soon replaced by Andy Summers) to form the new wave band The Police. The group had several chart-topping albums and won six Grammy Awards in the early 1980s. [PAR] Although they jumped on the punk bandwagon early in their career, The Police soon abandoned that sound in favor of reggae-tinged rock and minimalist pop. Their last album, Synchronicity, which included their most successful song, "" Every Breath You Take"", was released in 1983. [PAR] In September 1981 Sting made his first live solo appearance, performing on all four nights of the fourth Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policeman's Other Ball at the invitation of producer Martin Lewis. He also led an all-star band (dubbed The Secret Police) on his own arrangement of Bob Dylan's, ""I Shall Be Released"". The band and chorus included Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck,  Phil Collins, Bob Geldof, and Midge Ure, all of whom (except Beck) later worked together on Live Aid. [PAR] His performances were featured prominently in the album and film of the show and drew Sting major critical attention. Sting's participation in The Secret Policeman's Other Ball was the beginning of his growing involvement in raising money and consciousness for political and social causes.

Their scheme includes three classes of objects: ""small solar system bodies"" (including most asteroids and comets ), the much larger planets (including Earth , Jupiter , and so on), and the new category of in-between sized ""dwarf planets"". [PAR] There are currently five official dwarf planets. Pluto , formerly the smallest of the nine ""traditional"" planets, was demoted to dwarf planet status. Ceres , the largest asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, was also declared a dwarf planet. The three other (for now!) dwarf planets are Eris , Makemake , and Haumea . Pluto, Makemake, and Haumea orbit the Sun on the frozen fringes of our Solar System in the Kuiper Belt . Eris, also a Trans-Neptunian Object , is even further from the Sun. [PAR] What's the difference between regular planets and dwarf planets? As you might guess, it's partly an issue of size, with dwarf planets being smaller. But just how big does a planet need to be to become a full-fledged planet instead of a dwarf? You might think the minimum size requirement is arbitrary, but the size cutoff is actually based on other properties of the object and its history in the Solar System. [PAR] Both planets and dwarf planets orbit the Sun , not other planets (in which case we call them moons). Both must be large enough that their own gravity pulls them into the shapes of spheres; this rules out numerous smaller bodies like most asteroids, many of which have irregular shapes . Planets clear smaller objects out of their orbits by sucking the small bodies into themselves or flinging them out of orbit. Dwarf planets, with their weaker gravities, are unable to clear out their orbits. [PAR] Though there are just five dwarf planets now, their number is expected to grow. Scientists estimate there may be 70 dwarf planets amongst outer solar system objects that have been discovered already. Since we don't know the actual sizes or shapes of many of the objects we've found (because they are so far away), we can't yet determine whether they are actually dwarf planets or not. More observations and better telescopes will help us determine which other objects are dwarf planets. Astronomers speculate that there may be 200 or so dwarf planets out through the distance of the Kuiper Belt , an icy band of frozen planetoids on the edge of our Solar System.

Currently they are spread mainly in the USA and Australia. If you talk about US customary gallons and pints, it is not difficult to find the right answer to the question, “How many pints are in one gallon?” It is widely known that one US gallon consists of 8 US pints. [PAR] US and Imperial Gallons and Pints [PAR] There are different definitions of the gallon and the pint, but nowadays only three of them are in use. They are the imperial gallon (about 4.54 liters), the US liquid gallon (3.78 liters), and the US dry gallon (about 4.4 liters). To say the truth, dry gallons are also used very rarely, so it makes sense to consider only US liquid gallons and imperial gallons. [PAR] As for pints, we have the same picture. There are three main definitions of the pint: the imperial pint (about 0.57 liters), the US liquid pint (about 0.47 liters), and the less common US dry pint (about 0.55 liters). [PAR] If you are going to convert gallons to pints within the scope of the same system, you will have no problems, because in all of them eight pints make up one gallon. [PAR] One US liquid gallon equals to 8 US liquid pints [PAR] One US dry gallon equals to 8 US dry pints [PAR] One imperial gallon equals to 8 imperial pints [PAR] All you have to do is to multiply the number of gallons by eight, and you will know how many pints are in them. [PAR] But converting units from different systems is not so easy. We have composed the special table that will help you to do it, though you may need a calculator to perform this task. [PAR] Using Pints and Gallons [PAR] Pints and gallons are the common measurements for distributing different fluids. In the USA, petrol is usually dispensed by gallons.

"[DOC] [TLE] Why is the chlorophyll in plants green ... - UCSB Science LineUCSB Science Line [PAR] UCSB Science Line [PAR] Why is the chlorophyll in plants green or even  red, orange, or brown? [PAR] Answer 1: [PAR] The purpose of photosynthesis is to convert the energy in photons (the infinitesimally small packets of energy that make up light) into the chemical bonds of sugar molecules. [PAR] Plants (and animals that eat plants) can then store the energy and get it back out when they need it by breaking those chemical bonds.  The tricky part of photosynthesis is that it takes a very precise amount of energy to form a particular chemical bond.  Furthermore, the photons from different colors of light contain different amounts of energy. [PAR] You  probably know the colors of the spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet); well, those colors are in ascending order of energy -- a photon of blue light has more energy than a photon of red light (this is true because of Planck's Law, which a physicist could explain better than I). [PAR] A particular pigment molecule (like chlorophyll) is specialized for absorbing a particular color of light and converting the light energy into the appropriate amount of chemical energy for making a chemical bond (actually there are many other molecules that help the pigment perform this energy conversion, but only the pigment itself can absorb the light).   Chlorophyll just absorbs blue and red light; it hardly absorbs any green light at all, so the green gets reflected back to our eyes, which is why leaves appear green.  Other pigments that plants have in their leaves absorb light of different colors, so they reflect red, orange, yellow, or blue light and appear to be those colors to our eyes.  Because the white light coming from the sun is actually made up of photons of all the different colors, it is very advantageous to the plant to have many pigments that can absorb such a wide range of the available colors of light. [PAR] Answer 2: [PAR] Chlorophyll is a green pigment that gives most plants their color.The reason that it is green is because it absorbs other colors of light such as red and blue, so in a way the green light is reflected out since the pigment does not absorb it. Plants contain other pigments that reflect different colors, but these are often masked by Chlorophyll.  An example of another common pigment is the carotenoids.  During autumn, when the days begin to shorten, the amount of chlorophyll in the leaves of trees is dramatically reduced. This is when the colors of the carotenoids become more prevalent and is what you see when the leaves appear to change color. [PAR] Answer 3: [PAR] Different photosynthetic organisms use different combinations of pigments, which have different colors because they absorb and reflect different frequencies of light. [PAR] Plants and green algae (plants are really advanced green algae) contain chlorophyll a (which is teal-green), chlorophyll b (which is yellow-green), and beta-carotene (which is yellow), thus giving them a green color. Brown algae and their unicellular relatives (e.g. diatoms) have chlorophyll a,chlorophyll c, and lipid pigments called fucoxanthins,which together give them a golden-brown color. Red algae possess chlorophyll a and lipid-based pigments called phycobilins, which give them the brilliant red(or deep blue) color. These different combinations of pigments are more or less efficient at collecting light at certain frequencies and at certain levels of light intensity (too much will damage the pigment). Thus, they parcel out the Sun's energy to make the most use of it and to not compete with other photosynthetic organisms. [PAR] Answer 4: [PAR] I'm a little confused about your question. Chlorophyll pigment is always green. Plant leaves and stems aren't always green because they have many pigments other than chlorophyll. [PAR] Pigments are molecules that absorb specific colors of light and reflect other colors, depending on their chemical structure. The reflected colors are what give pigments their color. Chlorophyll pigments are green because they reflect green light.

"[DOC] [TLE] Silkworm Shop - How to care for silkworms and how to raise ...Silkworm Shop - How to care for silkworms and how to raise silkworms [PAR] General Information, Caring For & Breeding Silkworms [PAR] Background [PAR] Silkworms are the larva of a moth (Bombyx mori) native to Asia that spins a cocoon of fine, strong, lustrous fiber that is the source of commercial silk. The culture of silkworms is called sericulture. The various species raised today are distinguished by the quality of the silk they produce. Silkworms feed on the leaves of the mulberries (genus Morus) and sometimes on the Osage orange (Maclura pomifera). [PAR] Bombyx Mori will not bite, making it an ideal worm for feeding most reptiles, amphibians and other animals. And they offer great nutritional value as a live feeder. [PAR] Mulberry Leaves [PAR] Newborns are small enough for most baby reptiles to eat and young silkworms can even be fed so they will grow to a desired size. Silkworms are soft-bodied, slow moving and can grow to 3 inches in length. They are also relatively fast growing, reaching about 3 inches in length and ready to cocoon in as little as 25 - 28 days. [PAR] Silkworm and Cocoon [PAR] Silkworms go through four stages of development, as do most insects: egg, larva, pupa and adult. Click here to see a life cycle chart . The adult (imago) stage is the silkworm moth. The larva is the caterpillar (not really a ""worm"" at all).  The pupa is what the silkworm changes into after spinning its cocoon before emerging as a moth. Since the silkworm grows so much, it must shed its skin four times while it is growing. These stages-within-a-stage are called instars. [PAR] Today, the silkworm moth lives only in captivity. Silkworms have been domesticated so that they can no longer survive independently in nature, [PAR] particularly since they have lost the ability to fly. All wild populations are extinct. Also contributing to their extinction is the extraordinary fact that they only eat mulberry leaves. [PAR] Silkworms have been used by researchers to study pheromones or sexual attractant substances. The pheromones are released by female moths and the males detect the chemicals with olfactory hairs on their antennae. This allows the male to find the female for mating. The male antennae are made of many small hairs to increase the chances of picking up small amounts of the pheromones over long distances. [PAR] How to Grow Your Worms to the Perfect Size [PAR] Silkworm Eggs and Moth [PAR] The great thing about silkworms is that they only grow as much as you feed them, and they can go for up to a week without food. Keep in mind, however, that they will become dehydrated and begin to die off after a few days without food, and should be fed at least once daily in order to remain healthy. But, in general, if you have too many you can feed them a few times per week and they'll stay alive until you need them without growing too much larger. [PAR] Wash hands thoroughly before handling the worms or the food or they may develop bacterial problems. Using a cheese grater, grate a small amount of food onto the them and repeat until the caterpillars reach the desired size. For best results, maintain temperatures between 78° and 88° F. [PAR] Excessive condensation forming in the container after feeding is the leading cause of failure. If this condensation does form, take the lid off your container and allow the container and old food to completely dry out. In the future, make sure the previous food is dry before feeding again. Old damp food is a breeding ground for mold and other problems, dry food is not. A fan can help for quicker dry outs. [PAR] Newly hatched silkworms are tiny [PAR] As the silkworms grow, you may need to transfer your worms to a larger plastic container. The lid needs to have ventilation holes. If not, you need to vent the lid so the silkworms won't suffocate and to allow condensation to dissipate. You can also use a shoebox. The old food and waste matter can be removed, but does not have to be if",What does a silkworm feed on?,"['mulberries', 'mulberry']",ad532b1a0da4407b8afc4a0e3146e403,"[{'end': [564], 'start': [555]}, {'end': [1999, 818], 'start': [1992, 811]}]","∃x Feed(silkworm, x)"
"[DOC] [TLE] World Championships: Men's 110m hurdles - Athletics WeeklyWorld Championships: Men’s 110m hurdles [PAR] by Athletics Weekly July 26, 2015 [PAR] It’s the turn of the men’s 110m hurdles as we take an event-by-event look back at the IAAF World Championships [PAR] The home crowd for the inaugural championships in Helsinki in 1983 regarded the 110m hurdles as one of the highlights as they had a genuine medal hope in Arto Bryggare, who won both his heat and semi-final. The favourite, though, was Greg Foster who had won his semi-final in a much faster 13.22. [PAR] The Finn led for four hurdles before the American eased past and seemed to be on his way to a clear win, but then smashed the last two hurdles and was thrown off balance and was lucky to stay upright, only just winning in 13.42 from Bryggare’s 13.46. Foster and Bryggare went on to finish second and third in the 1984 Olympics behind Roger Kingdom. [PAR] The American successfully defended his title in Rome in 1987, setting a championship record of 13.20 in his heat and then winning the final in 13.21. The other two medals went to two British 20-year-olds. Jon Ridgeon was perhaps surprisingly the silver medallist and was even closing on Foster over the last few hurdles, running 13.29 despite dislocating his toe. Colin Jackson, who only just scraped into the final, took bronze. [PAR] Eight years after winning his first gold, Foster became the first athlete to win three in any event when he won in Tokyo in 1991, but it was close as he shared the winning time of 13.06 with his team-mate Jack Pierce, who pushed him all the way. [PAR] Jackson won his heat in 13.25 but scratched from the semi-final, although Britain still won another medal through Tony Jarrett who clocked 13.25 himself to push future Olympic champion Mark McKoy down to fourth. Jarrett had run 13.23 in his semi-final to beat Foster. [PAR] A clear world No.1, Jackson lost his chance of glory in the 1992 Olympics and, after a disappointing hurdling display, struggled in seventh. However, in the 1993 Worlds he proved unbeatable, running a perfect final and winning in a world record 12.91 to beat the four-year-old record of Roger Kingdom. Less than a metre behind, Jarrett also had the race of his life and improved his PB from 13.13 to a staggering 13.00. Foster didn’t make the USA team, but America nevertheless made the podium as Pierce returned to take third in 13.12. [PAR] Jackson was injured for Gothenburg in 1995, but Jarrett was back and in form. After being fastest in the second round and semi-final, he ran a great final, clocking 13.04 and won his third medal but fell half a metre short of Allen Johnson’s 13.00 victory. [PAR] Kingdom, the 1984 and 1988 Olympic champion, won his only world championships medal in third ahead of Pierce, who took his fourth top-four placing. [PAR] Johnson retained his title with an easier victory in Athens in 1997. He won in a superb 12.93, which was the fifth fastest time in history and just missed the American record. [PAR] Jackson made a successful return to championship racing and ran his fastest time for three years of 13.05 to complete his set of medals in second. Igor Kovac surprisingly took bronze and won Slovakia’s first championship medal in any event. [PAR] Johnson missed out on a third title as he withdrew injured from the semi-finals. America also suffered disappointment with sub-13 world leader Mark Crear disqualified from his quarter-final. Gold went to 32-year-old Jackson, who thus won his fourth medal, 12 years after his first. He won in a controlled 13.04 to edge Cuban Anier Garcia’s Central American record of 13.07. [PAR] The first two times were identical in 2001 in Edmonton as Johnson won his third title and Olympic champion Garcia matched his medal from Seville. For the first time for 18 years, there were no British medals, but Dudley Dorival won Haiti’s first medal in any event.

"[DOC] [TLE] Angel tube stationAngel is a London Underground station in the Angel area of the London Borough of Islington. It is on the Bank branch (eastern corollary) of the Northern line, between Old Street and King's Cross St. Pancras stations, in Travelcard Zone 1. The station was originally built by the City & South London Railway (C&SLR) and opened on 17 November 1901. The station served as a terminus until the line was extended to Euston on 12 May 1907. [PAR] The station was rebuilt in the early 1990s to accommodate the large number of passengers using the station. As a result, the station has an extra-wide southbound platform, the longest escalators on the Underground network and the fourth-longest escalators in Western Europe. It is also a proposed station on the Crossrail 2 proposed line (N. Surrey and S.W. London-S.E. Hertfordshire). [PAR] Location [PAR] On Islington High Street, the station provides access to several nearby Off West End, or Fringe theatre venues including the Old Red Lion Theatre, Sadler's Wells Theatre, the King's Head Theatre and the Almeida Theatre. It is also the nearest station to the main campus of City University and Chapel Market, a London street market, and the antiques market and dealers of Camden Passage. Between Angel and Old Street is the disused City Road station. [PAR] History [PAR] Angel station was originally built by the City & South London Railway (C&SLR), and opened on 17 November 1901 as the northern terminus of a new extension from Moorgate. The station building was designed by Sydney Smith and was on the corner of City Road and Torrens Street. On 12 May 1907, the C&SLR opened a further extension from Angel to Euston and Angel became a through station. [PAR] As with many of the C&SLR's stations, it was originally built with a single central island platform serving two tracks in a single tunnel – an arrangement still seen at Clapham North and Clapham Common (as of 2015). Access to the platforms from street level was via three Euston Anderson electric lifts before the rebuilding of the station. When the C&SLR line was closed for tunnel reconstruction in the early 1920s to accommodate larger trains, the station façade was reclad with tiling and the lifts were replaced by new ones from Otis. [PAR] Station rebuilding [PAR] For years since its opening, the station regularly suffered from overcrowding and had a very narrow island platform (barely 12 ft in width), which constituted a major safety issue and caused justified fear among passengers.  Consequently, the station was comprehensively rebuilt in the early 1990s. A new section of tunnel was excavated for a new northbound platform, and the southbound platform was rebuilt to completely occupy the original 30-foot tunnel, leaving it wider than most deep-level platforms on the system. The lifts and the ground-level building were closed and a new station entrance was opened on 10 August 1992 around the corner in Islington High Street together with the northbound platform while the southbound platform opened on 17 September 1992. Because of the distance between the new entrance and the platforms, and their depth, two flights of escalators were required, aligned approximately at a right angle. [PAR] The station today [PAR] The station's ticket hall has a sculpture of an Angel by Kevin Boys. Angel is also one of the number of stations to have only escalator access to the platforms.  [PAR] Escalators [PAR] With a vertical rise of 27 m and a length of 60 m, Angel station has the longest escalators on the Underground, and the fourth-longest set of escalators in Western Europe (after Náměstí Míru in the Prague Metro at 87 m, Västra skogen in the Stockholm Metro at 67 m and Kamppi station in the Helsinki Metro at 64 m).  The escalators at Angel were also the longest in the United Kingdom until they were surpassed in 2008 by the those at Heathrow Terminal 5A, to connect the main building with the people moving system to the satellite terminals. [PAR] Station improvements [PAR] The station was refurbished (as of 2015) and work began on 2 January 2007.

Consumers often purchase paper in the form of reams, while printers may work in even bigger volumes. This amount is also used as unit of base measurement for calculating the weight of paper, which is a reference to its density. Weight is usually indicated with the pound symbol (#), often on the endcap of a ream so that consumers can refer to this information when selecting paper. [PAR] Originally, a paper ream was made up of 20 quires, sheaves consisting of 24 sheets of paper, meaning that a ream actually contained 480 sheets. The definition of “quire” itself has also changed through the ages, but this is an entirely separate issue. To add to the chaos, printers usually purchased reams that contained 516 sheets of paper, to account for potential wastage. Ultimately, many paper companies adopted a 500 sheet standard to reduce confusion. [PAR] Ad [PAR] It is still possible to find a so-called “short ream” of only 480 sheets, however. Short reams are more common with fine or unique papers, but they do crop up in the realm of office supplies as well. Consumers should check for a label that will indicate whether or not a package of paper is a short ream. This can become especially critical for shoppers who are purchasing paper by the case, as a case of ten short reams will fall short of the 5,000 sheets of paper one would expect. [PAR] As discussed above, the paper ream is also used to measure paper density. When writing paper is labeled as 20#, for example, it means that a stack of 500 sheets that measure 17 by 22 inch (36 by 56 centimeter) weighs 20 pounds (9 kilograms). Other types of paper use different base sizes. In countries that use the metric system, many paper companies standardize this measurement, using 1 square meter as the basis size for a ream when determining weight, no matter what kind of paper it is.

Co-ordination and motor skills impaired; increased swaying [PAR] Source: Johns Hopkins University [PAR] As the range and strength of alcoholic drinks continues to grow, BBC News Online looks at how to work out exactly how much you are drinking. [PAR] Many of us are familiar with the system of measuring alcohol content in ""units"". [PAR] We are told, for instance, that for women 14 units of alcohol a week is the recommended limit, and for men 21. [PAR] Many of us have been told a glass of wine is the equivalent of one unit, and a pint of lager two. [PAR] But the system was devised over 20 years ago, and since then the strength and variety of drinks available has changed dramatically. [PAR] One glass of wine rarely now equals just one unit of alcohol. [PAR] This rough guide was based on a glass of wine at 8% ABV (alcohol by volume) in a 125ml glass - a measure and strength no longer widely available. [PAR] Nowadays, a standard glass of wine is served in a 175ml glass and is often up to 13% ABV, which adds up to 2.3 units. [PAR] Similarly, a half-pint glass of beer is only equivalent to one unit if the alcohol content is 3.5%, but most lagers on sale today are much stronger and a pint could easily be 2.8 units. [PAR] How many units? [PAR] But there is a sum which helps you work out how many units you have drunk. [PAR] You need to know the strength of the drink (%ABV) and amount of liquid in millimetres (one pint is 568ml; a standard glass of wine 175ml). [PAR] You multiply the amount of drink in millilitres by the percentage ABV, and then divide by 1,000. [PAR] For example, if you order a pint of strong lager at 8% ABV: [PAR] 1 pint (568ml) X 8 = 4,544 [PAR] Divided by 1,000 = 4.544, or 4.5 units [PAR] That is much stronger than the two units many people assume it would contain - and means just over three pints of strong lager would reach the recommended weekly limit for women. [PAR] What about drinking and driving - how many units is safe to drink before getting behind the wheel? [PAR] The legal drink-drive limit is 80mg per 100 millilitres of blood.

Jackson purchased the property in 1987 for $19.5 million, but defaulted on a $24.5 million loan in 2008. The ranch is currently owned by the Estate of Michael Jackson, with private investment firm Colony Capital maintaining a 12.5 percent stake.

It contained a floral clock, two railroads, bumper cars, a super slide, a roller coaster, an arcade and more. One of the railroads was called the ""Neverland Valley Railroad,"" with a steam locomotive named after his mother, Katherine. The fully-functional zoo contained giraffes, parrots, elephants and alpacas.

The origin of its name is contested by                     historians but is most likely consistent with Stow’s explanation in his Survey of London: [PAR] Then haue yee one other lane called Rother Lane, or Red                         Rose Lane, of such a signe there, now commonly called Pudding Lane, because the Butchers of Eastcheape haue their skalding House for Hogges                     there, and their puddinges [entrails] with other filth of Beastes, are voided                     downe that way to theyr dung boates on the Thames [PAR] ( 1.210–11 ). Henry A. Harben, Gillian Bebbington, and                     Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert support Stow’s account of the origin.                     However, Edward Waterhouse (1619–1670) gives a different explanation in his                     Narrative, understanding pudding as a favourite national dish rather than the                     medieval word for [PAR] guts and entrails [PAR] ( Weinreb and Hibbert 625 ). Edward Waterhouse introduces Pudding Lane as [PAR] a place so called, but for some                     eminent seller or sellers of Puddings living of old there, [PAR] it being a regular                     practice to name streets after that which was produced or sold in the vicinity                     (as in Bread Street , Milk                         Street , and Candlewick Street ). He dubs                     pudding [PAR] the general beloved diſh of Engliſh men [PAR] Pudding Lane ran south from Little Eastcheap down to Thames Street , with New Fish Street ( Newfyshe Streat ) framing it on the west and Botolph Lane on the east. The only                     intersecting street on Pudding Lane is St. George’s Lane , and the nearby parishes include St. Margaret’s , St.                         Magnus’s , St. Botolph’s , St. George’s , and St.                         Leonard, Eastcheap . On Ekwall’s map it is labeled as [PAR] Rother (Pudding) Lane [PAR] after Stow’s account of the                     lane’s former title. Pudding Lane is contained                     within Billingsgate Ward . [PAR] Eastcheap (the eastern counterpart to Westcheap or Cheapside , ceap meaning                     originally to barter and eventually becoming                     the noun for market) was the primary meat                     market in London. Pudding Lane was lined with                     butchers’ stalls ( Bebbington 120 ).                     Bebbington notes that in 1402 the butchers were granted an alley where they                     might dispose of entrails known as puddings. Pudding                         Lane ran conveniently towards the river from Eastcheap . Harben reports that butchers were licenced [PAR] to build a bridge over the Thames with houses thereon,                     whence they might cast offal into the Thames at ebb-tide [PAR] In Stow’s time the lane was [PAR] chiefly inhabited by Basketmakers, Turners and                     Butchers [PAR] ( Stow 1.211 ). Waterhouse,                     writing later in the seventeenth century, remarks that [PAR] people of labour and                     poor condition ply [PAR] in this [PAR] working early in the morning and                     late at night [PAR] when the Tyde serves to bring up Fishermen, Passengers, and other                     Boats and Portages. [PAR] They would then sell their puddings, hoping to [PAR] bring the                     place in request [PAR] with travelers ( sig.                         C8v ). Al Smith remarks that the butchers have since relocated to Smithfield and Leadenhall markets ( 164–65 ), a progression that likely began in the late seventeenth and                     early eighteenth centuries. [PAR] The Great Fire began on Sunday, 2 September 1666 at around 2 a.m. in the house                     of Thomas Farriner (also Farryner), the King’s baker, [PAR] at a site which is now                     occupied by 25 Pudding Lane [PAR] ( Smith 164–65 ). Due to a strong eastern wind, the                     flames spread quickly throughout the city and raged until Thursday 6 September,                     a full four days later, having consumed 89 churches, 13,200 houses and 400                     streets ( 145–46 ). The fire proceeded                     south from Pudding Lane towards the bridge, where                     it crossed Thames Street , ignited St. Magnus’s Church , destroyed London Bridge , and then blew north again, heading                     westward down Thames Street ( Vincent sig.

[PAR] Michael Becker/AP [PAR] Look up ""show business survivor"" on the Google machine, and you're likely to find a picture of Randy Jackson staring back at you. [PAR] That's a curious thought, as news breaks that Jackson is leaving Fox's American Idol singing competition after 13 years as a judge and mentor — the second-to-last person from the show's inaugural season left on the show, besides host Ryan Seacrest. [PAR] But the fact is, Jackson was officially gone from Idol once before and rumored to be headed out the door many times as the show descended from its peak as TV's most popular program. Still, somehow a 58-year-old guy who dresses like a Hot Topic explosion and talks like an extra from a mid-'90s rap video outlasted Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, Steven Tyler, Ellen DeGeneres and many more. [PAR] Will Fans Return To A Nicer 'Idol'? [PAR] That's why it's so painful to admit that, as Jackson leaves Idol after an undistinguished tenure as a mentor last season, he embodies everything that is wrong with the show right now — starting with what it did to his music career. [PAR] Many people who know Jackson as Idol's ""dawg""-spouting hipster in thick glasses don't realize that he was once one of music's most successful session bassists, working as a studio hired hand for top artists. Beginning with jazz fusion pioneers Jean-Luc Ponty and Billy Cobham, Jackson eventually built a resume that included Tracy Chapman, Aretha Franklin, the Divinyls, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Herbie Hancock and the Charlie Daniels Band. [PAR] Yes, he also joined Journey in the '80s when that band had the amazingly bad idea to replace its drummer and bassist with studio players. (The drummer had hair plugs and Jackson wore parachute pants. Deadly.) And he's also a producer who never hesitates to mention his work with Mariah Carey or the Grammy he's won (for a 2001 Gladys Knight record, he usually doesn't add). [PAR] Article continues after sponsorship [PAR] Randy Jackson performs with members of Journey at the 1987 Bay Area Music Awards. [PAR] Clayton Call/Redferns/Getty Images [PAR] I've often identified with Jackson, and not just because people occasionally mistake me for him at industry functions. I'm a music fan, and I'd seen his name on countless albums in the '80s and '90s, so I was excited when American Idol first announced his inclusion on the show's inaugural judging panel, along with Cowell and Abdul. ""Here's a player; a musician who gets it,"" I thought. ""This is a guy who will bring a musician's sensibility to this glitzy TV show."" [PAR] Unfortunately, the opposite happened. Ready to reach for the multimillion-dollar opportunities wrapped up in being a major TV star, Jackson wasn't a very articulate ambassador for a musician's point of view, and he didn't seem particularly interested in separating the truly talented performers from the eye candy stuck in the competition to add drama. (Watch Pharrell on NBC's The Voice or Harry Connick Jr. on Idol for examples of musicians turning their experience into valuable advice.) [PAR] The show has often overlooked more distinctive talents for competitors with a better TV story; the post-Idol careers of nonwinners like Jennifer Hudson, Chris Daughtry, Katharine McPhee and Adam Lambert seem strong evidence of that. Musicians like Jackson should have been a corrective for that dynamic, but he never had that kind of impact.

[PAR] At a meeting in London on April 8, 1982, shortly after the war began, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed concern to U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig about President Ronald Reagan's recent public statements of impartiality. In response, according to a previously secret memorandum of the conversation,ï¿½"" The Secretary said that he was certain the Prime Minister knew where the President stood. We are not impartial."" [PAR] On April 2, 1982, Argentine forces underï¿½de factoï¿½President Leopoldo Galtieri seized the Falkland/Malvinas Islands militarily from the U.K. The U.S. launched a major shuttle diplomacy mission, sending Secretary Haig numerous times to London and Buenos Aires to de-escalate the conflict. Though the U.S. did not formally announce support for the U.K. until April 30, newly released documents show that Washington sided with the British from the beginning, providing substantial logistical and intelligence support. In a conversation with British officials at the end of March, Haig declared that the U.S. diplomatic effortï¿½""will of course, have a greater chance of influencing Argentine behavior if we appear to them not to favor one side or the other."" [PAR] At the same time, the White House recognized that British intransigence would create problems for the U.S. in its dealings with Latin America.ï¿½ President Reagan, reacting to Haig's secret reports on the British position, wrote to the secretary :ï¿½""[Your report] makes clear how difficult it will be to foster a compromise that gives Maggie enough to carry on and at the same time meets the test of 'equity' with our Latin neighbors."" [PAR] Under Thatcher's leadership, the U.K. launched a large-scale military expedition that proved a logistical, communications, and intelligence challenge for the British Air Force and Navy. It would take the task force almost a month to traverse the 8,000 miles between England and the Falklands and prepare for combat around the South Atlantic islands. For the British, the expedition would not be justified without retaking the Falkland Islands and returning to theï¿½status quo ante. An analysis from the Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research predicted on April 6 thatï¿½""the effectiveness of the fleet, far from its maintenance bases, will rapidly deteriorate after its arrival on station. [Thatcher's] damaged leadership could not survive a futile 'voyage to nowhere.'"" [PAR] ""The Prime Minister has the bit in her teeth,""ï¿½ Haig reported to President Reagan on April 9, after the Argentine attack on the islands.ï¿½""She is clearly prepared to use force. Though she admits her preference for a diplomatic solution, she is rigid in her insistence on a return to the status quo ante, and indeed seemingly determined that any solution involve some retribution."" [PAR] Haig's report continued:ï¿½""It is clear that they had not thought much about diplomatic possibilities. They will now, but whether they become more imaginative or instead recoil will depend on the political situation and what I hear in Argentina."" [PAR] The documents reveal that initial covert U.S. support for Britain was discussed quite openly between the two nations. During the first meeting with Haig on April 8,ï¿½"" [Thatcher] expressed appreciation for U.S. cooperation in intelligence matters and in the use of [the U.S. military base at] Ascension Island.""ï¿½A series of CIA aerial photography analyses showed the level of detail of U.S. surveillance of Argentine forces on",Who was the President of Argentina at the time of the Falklands invasion in 1982 ?,['galtieri'],4ed596c302dd4e74968274a78e7ac8f2,"[{'end': [1502], 'start': [1495]}]","∃x PresidentOfArgentina(x, 1982) ∧ FalklandsInvasion(1982)"

"[DOC] [TLE] The Frog's Legacy""The Frog's Legacy"" is the sixth Christmas special episode of the BBC sitcom, Only Fools and Horses. It was first broadcast on 25 December 1987. In the episode, the Trotters search for the hidden gold legacy of Frederick ""Freddie the Frog"" Robdal, an old friend of their mother's. [PAR] Synopsis [PAR] Del Boy, Rodney and Albert attend the wedding of Trigger's niece, Lisa, who appeared in the episode ""Tea for Three"". Whilst there, Trigger's Aunt Renee (Joan Sims) tells Del about a known local gentleman thief, Freddie ""The Frog"" Robdal.  [PAR] It transpires that Del and Rodney's mother met Robdal and ""befriended"" him (a euphemism for Del's mother having had a brief affair with him, as was revealed she had done many times with a number of men throughout the series' development) before Rodney was born and while she and her husband Reg were having marital troubles. Renee describes Robdal as a very cultured man, into French wine and paintings. Robdal and his gang broke into a bank in London and stole £250,000 in gold bullion; the rest of the gang were apprehended by the Police, but Robdal escaped with the gold and hid it. It is on this information that Del embarks on a mission to find the lost gold, having inherited it from his mother on her death, who in turn, had had it bequeathed to her by Robdal in his will. [PAR] Uncle Albert, who knew Robdal vaguely during the war, finishes the tale later in the episode by stating that shortly after stealing the gold, and whilst still on the run from the Police, Robdal and an explosives expert known as ""Jelly"" Kelly, robbed a Post Office. During the robbery, Robdal inadvertently sat on a detonator, killing them both. Del mentions that he heard that Robdal had an affair with a married woman who lived on the estate and wonders why he left everything to Del and Rodney's mother. He also mentions a rumour that Robdal had an illegitimate child by that woman who would approximately be Rodney's age now. The throwaway remark begins to worry Rodney about the possibility that he may very well be that child, though Albert dismisses it as a rumour.  [PAR] During the course of the story, Del gets Rodney a new job, though he declines to mention that it is working for the local funeral directors as a chief mourner, a fact Rodney does not take kindly to when he finds out. While arguing with Del, he accidentally leads the hearse down a one-way street. However, through his job there Rodney finds out that Robdal purchased a coffin from Rodney's employers when they first started business for a ""friend"" named ""Alfred Broderick"". Rodney quickly deduces that ""Alfred Broderick"" is an anagram of ""Frederick Robdal"", implying that Broderick did not exist, and that Robdal had purchased the coffin to hide the gold in and had arranged a fake funeral for it to be buried. While attempting to sell a faulty computer to the priest who married Andy and Lisa, Del learns that the same priest also buried ""Mr Broderick"". He then finally learns of the gold's whereabouts. [PAR] Having failed to mention it earlier, Albert confirms that Robdal earned the nickname ""The Frog"" because he was a frogman in the Royal Navy. Consequently, he buried the gold at sea to hide it from the authorities and intended to recover it at an opportune moment, but was killed before he could do so. While Del vows to find the gold, Rodney once again asks Albert about his resemblance to Robdal; Albert just dismisses it as rumours, but does acknowledge that he and Robdal do look a bit alike. Rodney then surmises, ""Freddie the Frog. Killed himself by sitting on someone else's detonator. What a plonker."" [PAR] Episode cast [PAR] Story arc [PAR] This is the second occasion in the show's history that the issue of whether or not Rodney and Del share the same father is raised.

(Stone: Jan Goodman; photo: Tino Hammid) [PAR]   [PAR] Pigeon's blood:      Chasing the elusive Burmese bird [PAR] The Burmese term for ruby is padamya (`plenty of mercury').      Other terms for ruby are derived from the word for the seeds of      the pomegranate fruit. 13 Traditionally, the Burmese have referred to the finest hue of      ruby as ""pigeon's blood"" (ko-twe ), a term which      may be of Chinese (Anonymous, 1943) or Arab origin. Witness the      following from al-Akfani, who described thus the top variety of      ruby: [PAR] Rummani has the colour of the fresh seed of pomegranate      or of a drop of blood (drawn from an artery) on a highly polished      silver plate. [PAR] al-Akfani, ca. 1348 AD (from Sarma, 1984) [PAR] Some have compared this color to the center      of a live pigeon's eye (Brown & Day, 1955). Halford-Watkins      described it as a rich crimson without trace of blue overtones      (Anonymous, 1943). Others have defined this still further as the      color of the first two drops of blood from the nose of a freshly      slain Burmese pigeon. But the piece de resistance of pigeon's-blood      research has to be that of James Nelson (1985; Nelson discourages      use of such fanciful terms): [PAR] In an attempt to seek a more quantitative description      for this mysterious red colour known only to hunters and the few      fortunate owners of the best Burmese rubies, the author sought      the help of the London Zoo. Their Research Department were quick      to oblige and sent a specimen of fresh, lysed, aerated, pigeon's      blood. A sample was promptly spectrophotometered…. The Burmese      bird can at last be safely removed from the realms of gemmology      and consigned back to ornithology. [PAR] James B. Nelson, 1985, Journal of Gemmology [PAR] After that, the only question remaining      is whether or not ""spectrophotometered"" is a genuine      English verb. [PAR] Color preferences do change with time. The      preferred color today is not necessarily that of a hundred, or      even fifty, years ago. In the author's experience, the color      most coveted today is that akin to a red traffic signal or stoplight.      It is a glowing red color, due to the strong red fluorescence      of Burmese rubies, and is unequalled in the world of gemstones.      Thai rubies may possess a purer red body color, but the lack of      red fluorescence leaves them dull by comparison. It must be stressed      that the true pigeon's-blood red is extremely rare, more      a color of the mind than the material world. One Burmese trader      expressed it best when he said ""…asking to see the pigeon's      blood is like asking to see the face of God."" (Nordland,      1982) [PAR] The second-best color in Burma is termed      ""rabbit's blood,"" or yeong-twe. It is a slightly darker, more bluish red. Third best is a deep      hot pink termed bho-kyaik. This was      the favorite color of the famous Mogok gem dealer, A.C.D. Pain.      U Thu Daw, longtime Mogok dealer and a contemporary of Pain's,      has stated that bho-kyaik is not so much a color term, as an overall      quality description. To qualify, a ruby must fulfill six requirements.      First, it must be at least one carat. Second, the color must be      of the third quality (exceeded only by ko-twe and yeong-twe ).      The table facet must be perpendicular to the c axis, it must be      well cut, of good luster and eye clean. The literal meaning of      bho-kyaik is ""preference of the British"" (U Hla Win,",Rubies and Sapphires are exactly alike except in colour?,['true'],500a9b5044a24e39ba788d643162d732,"[{'end': [2671], 'start': [2668]}]","∃x (IsRuby(x) ∧ IsSapphire(x) ∧ ∀y (IsColor(y, x) → (y = RubyColor ∨ y = SapphireColor)))"

The two first met when they accidentally mixed up their raincoats in the cloak room, and met again at a disco later that night, at which Rodney's friends Mickey Pearce and Jevon unsuccessfully ask her for a dance. Rodney then bet £20 that he would be successful and, to their horror, she agreed to dance with him. Cassandra also offered to give him a lift home, and they exchanged telephone numbers. However, as he was ashamed to take her home to Nelson Mandela House, he pretended he lived in a more upmarket location on King's Avenue and was duly left stranded as it began to pour with rain, again getting their coats mixed up leaving Rodney to walk home. [PAR] Originally John Sullivan wanted to make Cassandra a girlfriend of Trigger, Denzil or an admirer of Boycie, but decided that like he planned to do with Del, Rodney needed a long term relationship. [PAR] Their relationship blossomed throughout the sixth series; In The Unlucky Winner Is... she went to Spain with Rodney and Del, and had to pretend to be Del's wife, and Rodney's stepmother. In Sickness and Wealth, Rodney announced that they were engaged; they married in the final episode of series 6: Little Problems, after which they moved into their own flat. Her marriage to Rodney was not without its problems; Rodney was envious of Cassandra's privileged upbringing and her qualifications. When Cassandra wanted to build herself a career at the bank, Rodney was outraged, as he wanted her to be little more than a housewife, and have his dinner on the table for when he got home from work. [PAR] After a year of being married she and Rodney split up in The Jolly Boys Outing (the 1989 Christmas special), when he punched her boss and broke his nose. In the next episode aired Rodney Come Home (Christmas special 1990), they broke up again, which started an ongoing split between the pair. This split carried on throughout the duration of series 7. In The Chance of a Lunchtime Del played matchmaker between the two, reuniting them. However, the two were only together for an hour before Cassandra saw Rodney with an ex-fiancē of Del Boy's. Assuming that Rodney was cheating on her, Cassandra locked him out of the flat. They were ultimately reconciled in Three Men, a Woman and a Baby but after just getting back together they were interrupted by a phone call that Raquel had gone into labour and Del wanted Rodney to be there for the birth. The episode Miami Twice saw them trying to patch up their relationship, and in Mother Natures Son they were back together properly, and stayed together ever since. The later episodes saw them attempting to conceive a child, and Cassandra was promoted to head of small business investment at the local bank. After suffering a miscarriage in ""Modern Men"", she and Rodney later had a daughter, Joan (named after Del and Rodney's late mother), in Sleepless in Peckham.

"[DOC] [TLE] Chain (unit)A chain (ch) is a unit of length. It measures 66 feet, or 22 yards, or 100 links,  or 4 rods (20.1168 m). There are 10 chains in a furlong, and 80 chains in one statute mile. An acre is the area of 10 square chains (that is, an area of one chain by one furlong). The chain has been used for several centuries in Britain and in some other countries influenced by British practice. [PAR] By extension, chainage (running distance) is the distance along a curved or straight survey line from a fixed commencing point, as given by an odometer. [PAR] Origin [PAR] The chain was commonly used with the mile to indicate land distances and in particular in surveying land for legal and commercial purposes. Starting in the 19th century, the chain was used as a subdivision with the mile to show distances between railway stations, tunnels and bridges. In medieval times, local measures were commonly used, and many units were adopted that gave manageable units; for example the distance from London to York could be quoted in inches, but the resulting huge number would be unmemorable. The locally used units were often inconsistent from place to place. [PAR] In countries influenced by English practice, land plans prepared before about 1960 associated with the sale of land usually have lengths marked in chains and links, and the areas of land parcels are indicated in acres. A rectangle of land one furlong in length and one chain in width has an area of one acre. [PAR] Instrument [PAR] In 1620, the clergyman Edmund Gunter developed a method of surveying land accurately with low technology equipment, using what became known as Gunter's chain; this was 66 feet long and from the practice of using his chain, the word transferred to the actual measured unit. His chain had 100 links, and the link is used as a subdivision of the chain as a unit of length. [PAR] Ramsden's chain [PAR] American surveyors sometimes used a longer chain of 100 feet (30.48 m), also of 100 links, known as the engineer's chain or Ramsden's chain.  The first such was constructed by Jesse Ramsden for the measurement of the Hounslow baseline at the start of the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790).  The term chain in this case usually refers to the measuring instrument rather than a unit of length; the distances measured with such an instrument are normally measured in feet (and usually decimal fractions of a foot, not inches). The unit symbol for a single Ramsden's link is lk.   [PAR] Other instruments [PAR] Also in North America a modern variant of the chain as a tool is used in forestry for traverse surveys.  This modern chain is a static cord (thin rope), 50 metres long, marked with a small tag at each metre, and also marked in the first metre every decimetre.  When working in dense bush, a short  axe or hatchet is commonly tied to the end of the chain, and thrown through the bush in the direction of the traverse, to ease working in dense forest. [PAR] Another version used extensively in forestry and surveying is the hip-chain.  A hip-chain is a small box containing a string meter, worn on the hip. The user simply ties the spooled string off to a stake or tree and the meter counts distance as the user walks away in a straight line.  These instruments are available in both feet and meters. [PAR] Contemporary use [PAR] In Britain, the chain is no longer used for practical survey work.  However it survives on the railways of the United Kingdom as a location identifier. When railways were designed the location of features such as bridges and stations was indicated by a cumulative longitudinal ""mileage"", using miles and chains, from a zero point at the origin or headquarters of the railway, or the originating junction of a new branch line. Since railways are entirely linear in topology, the ""mileage"" or ""chainage"" is sufficient to identify a place uniquely on any given route. Thus a certain bridge may be said to be ""at"" 112",How many yards are there in a chain?,['22'],f34dadccd9884a278cd6ea612f89e235,"[{'end': [83], 'start': [82]}]","∃y YardsInChain(y, 'chain')"

He is played by Jim Broadbent and, in the prequel Rock and Chips, by Calum MacNab. [PAR] Only Fools and Horses [PAR] Background [PAR] Despite only ever making three on-screen appearances, Slater's background is revealed in some detail during the course of the show's history. [PAR] As a child, Slater longed to be part of Del Boy's gang at school as they used to sit next to each other in class, but he was always an outsider, widely reviled amongst his peers and renowned for his slyness. Eventually, out of contempt for the others rejecting him, Slater joined the police force at the age of 18 and frequently engaged in unethical activity to attempt to frame and prosecute not just his old school friends but anyone possible, including his own family as revealed in ""May the Force Be with You"". [PAR] His own corruption would eventually turn him to crime, leading him into illegal diamond smuggling which is the main focus of the episode ""To Hull and Back"" and a strong part of the plot to ""The Class of '62"". His initial prosecution of diamond smuggling landed him a five year prison sentence. [PAR] Del's long-term partner Raquel Turner is discovered to be Slater's ex-wife in ""The Class of '62"", to whom he was married to for four years before separating. Raquel would frequently comment throughout the show's history how much of a horrible husband he could be. [PAR] ""May the Force Be with You"" [PAR] Slater is introduced in ""May the Force Be with You"", the fifth episode of series three, having recently been promoted to the position of Detective Inspector. He has returned to Peckham and is investigating the theft of a microwave oven which turns out to be connected to Del. [PAR] The nature of his character and certain details of his past are revealed in this episode, including his rejection from his peers, his corrupt practices and his generally sly nature. As well as the main characters making clear their thoughts and attitudes towards him, his own colleague PC Terry Hoskins reveals that even his peers in the police service despise him, and Slater admits during the episode to having arrested his own father in the past, alienating him from his family. [PAR] ""To Hull and Back"" [PAR] In ""To Hull and Back"", Slater's involvement in crime is the main focus of the storyline, with the Trotters becoming involved in a diamond smuggling operation part-headed - unbeknownst to them - by Slater. [PAR] His position of authority within the police has been exploited a number of times to successfully smuggle diamonds into England, and over the course of the episode he almost succeeds again, only to be foiled by PC Hoskins who drives him into a sting and lands Slater with a five year prison sentence. [PAR] ""The Class of '62"" [PAR] Slater's final appearance in character was in ""The Class of '62"", in which he has been paroled from prison and returns to Peckham, setting up a school reunion to which Del, Boycie, Trigger, and Denzil are invited, with Rodney joining them. [PAR] Over the course of the episode, it is learnt that Del's partner Raquel is Slater's ex-wife, and the school reunion was merely a set-up to gain contact with her regarding his divorce proceedings, as he knew from the start that she was living with Del. It is also revealed that Slater has returned to the illegal diamond trade, which Del and Rodney use to blackmail Slater into giving Raquel a fair divorce, leaving her alone and leaving Peckham for good, under the threat of them informing the police about Slater's return to crime. This prompts Slater's departure from the series. [PAR] NB. Slater appears once more in the series but not in a character appearance, in the final episode ""Sleepless in Peckham"" when Del and Rodney are given an old photograph of the very first Jolly Boys' outing from 1960, in which Slater is pictured.

"[DOC] [TLE] 'Til Murder Do Us Part: 15 Couples Who Killed (Volume 3 ...'Til Murder Do Us Part: 15 Couples Who Killed (Volume 3) - Absolute Crime [PAR] Introduction   [PAR]  For most people, murder becomes more interesting and entertaining when killers come in twos. Murderous pairs and killers are so fascinating to us because they pervert the basic human needs for love and companionship into something truly evil and wicked. [PAR] When lovers start killing, they debase love itself into a deadly evil. Pals that kill together turn friendship into something monstrous and frightening. Instincts and emotions that should make life better become a deadly threat to all of us. [PAR] Under normal circumstances, love and friendship make people better. Persons with somebody to believe in and trust are often braver and harder working. Those with somebody to fight for are often willing to struggle on until the bitter end. [PAR] When a deadly pair is involved, something similar occurs. A person who would normally lack the courage to kill or rape or rob suddenly gets the courage to do so. Friendship and love can be just as empowering for killers, cannibals, and sadists as for the rest of us. Therefore we should always be afraid when those who look twisted or weird get together; it could be the beginnings of a deadly duo. [PAR] A Murderous Duo Too Horrific to Be Real—or Were They? Sweeney Todd and Margery Lovett   [PAR]  The story of Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street who murdered his customers, and his deadly paramour Margery Lovett, who made the victims’ bodies into meat pies, seems almost too horrific to be true. Yet there is probably a lot of truth behind the legend of the gruesome hairdresser and his murderous mate who have inspired everything from nursery rhymes to Broadway musicals. [PAR] Sweeney Todd and Margery Lovett were apparently real people. They were the first celebrity serial killers to be extensively covered in the press. The deadly duo was also the first pair of sadistic cannibals to be widely glorified in popular culture. Sweeney and Margery were stock characters in pulp magazines and dime novels as early as the 1850s. [PAR] The strangest thing about Sweeney Todd and Margery Lovett is that nothing is certain about them. We know that they were real people and that they certainly killed innocent people, but that’s about it. Nobody knows how many people they killed, why they killed them, or even how they killed them. [PAR]   The Man, the Woman, and the Legend   [PAR]  The legend of Sweeney Todd and Margery Lovett is a well-known and gruesome one. Sweeney Todd operated a barbershop, where he would shave men; he would occasionally kill a customer with his straight razor and then dump the body in a secret pit under the barber shop. Margery Lovett, who owned a pie shop nearby, would have one of her accomplices cut up the body and serve it in a meat pie. [PAR] To add icing on the cake, Sweeney’s barbershop and Margery’s pie shop were located on Fleet Street, the legendary home of London’s newspapers: the place where tabloid journalism and crime reporting were born. Sweeney and Margery’s trial was covered by the first crime reporter, Thomas Peckett Prest. They pushed Napoleon off the front pages back in 1801. [PAR] Okay, that’s the legend, but it’s hard to tell what's fact and what’s fiction in this tale. Records were poor back in 1801, organized police forces were in their infancy, and journalism was a purely amateur affair. Discerning fact from fiction and legend from reality is difficult even though Sweeney Todd committed his crimes in the center of what was then the world’s largest and most advanced city. [PAR]   What We Know   [PAR] Sweeney Todd was a young man who grew up in London near the Tower of London. He apprenticed as a barber—then a good job because there was no way for a man to shave himself at the time. He apparently served a prison term for theft and then spent several years operating as an independent, or flying, barber on the streets until he made enough money to open his own shop.

[PAR] Challenging Conditions [PAR] Vinho Verde is Portugal's largest wine region.  It is also one of the most challenging places to produce wine in the entire country.  Unlike many Portuguese wine regions, Vinho Verde is not protected by northern or western mountain ranges.  The region's borders start at the Minho River, which separates northern Portugal from Spain, and follow the Atlantic coast south to Oporto.  South of Oporto, the wine region's border follows and then crosses the Douro River.  Several other rivers, including the Ave, Lima and Cávado, crisscross Vinho Verde.  The region is perhaps 50 miles across at its widest point. [PAR] Thanks to its coastal Atlantic setting, Vinho Verde's climate is mild and damp.  The area gets about 59 inches of rain per year, much of it in spring and fall.  This makes planting, protecting and harvesting the grapes very challenging, to say the least.  Given the constant threat of rot, fungus and frost, it's a wonder any grapes survive at all. [PAR] Over the years, Vinho Verde growers have developed several creative ways to minimize threats to their grapes.  If you visit Vinho Verde, you will see vines trailing along strings and wires, arching overhead, pergola-style, and even climbing up the trunks of trees.  Some growers encourage their grapevines to grow along cross-shaped structures or up vertical poles.  These methods developed for two reasons: first, to save space and leave room for farming beneath the grapevines, and, second, to grow the grapes high enough to allow air to flow around the plants. [PAR] Soil and Terrain [PAR] Vinho Verde's soils are mainly granite-based and sandy.  There are some areas where schist or slate and clay predominate.  Soils here tend to be high in acidity.  The majority of the slopes in Vinho Verde are gentle, but some vineyards are planted on steep or terraced slopes.[DOC] [TLE] Vinho Verde Cellars & Wine Tasting Tour - Porto | ExpediaVinho Verde Cellars & Wine Tasting Tour - Porto | Expedia [PAR] Vinho Verde Cellars & Wine Tasting Tour [PAR] by Sightseeing Tours Shop Duration 9h Free cancellation [PAR] Cancellation Policy [PAR] You can cancel free of charge until 72 hours before your reservation starts.

Like Armenia's ""Armenian Coffee,"" ""Cypriot Coffee"" in Cyprus, Serbian ""Domestic Coffee,"" and ""Bosnian Coffee"" in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the term ""Greek Coffee"" is Greece's way of laying claim to something that is very much a part of their culture, even though Turkey (which, along with other areas in the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Middle East and North Africa, claims to be origin of the drink) has often had dicey political relationships with these nations. (For example, Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974, straining relations between Greece and Turkey, and prompting the name change from ""Turkish Coffee"" to ""Greek Coffee."")

"[DOC] [TLE] Hollandaise sauceHollandaise sauce ( or;) is an emulsion of egg yolk and liquid butter, usually seasoned with lemon juice, salt, and a little white pepper or cayenne pepper.  In appearance, it is light yellow and opaque, smooth and creamy. The flavor is rich and buttery, with a mild tang added by an acidic component such as lemon juice, yet not so strong as to overpower mildly flavored foods. [PAR] Hollandaise is one  of the five sauces in the French haute cuisine mother sauce repertoire.  It is so named because it was believed to have mimicked a Dutch sauce for the King of the Netherlands' state visit to France. Hollandaise sauce is well known as a key ingredient of Eggs Benedict, and is often paired with vegetables such as steamed asparagus. [PAR] History [PAR] There is debate as to who originally developed hollandaise sauce. Some historians believe that it was invented in the Netherlands then taken to France by the Huguenots. In 1651, François Pierre La Varenne describes a sauce similar to hollandaise in his groundbreaking cookbook Le Cuisinier François: [PAR] ""avec du bon beurre frais, un peu de vinaigre, sel et muscade, et un jaune d’œuf pour lier la sauce"" (""with good fresh butter, a little vinegar, salt, and nutmeg, and an egg yolk to bind the sauce""). Alan Davidson notes a ""sauce à la hollandoise"" from François Marin's Les Dons de Comus (1758), but since that sauce included flour, bouillon, herbs, and omitted egg yolks, it may not be related to the modern hollandaise.  [PAR] However, Larousse Gastronomique states that, ""in former times fish 'à la hollandaise' was served with melted butter"" (implying that at one time egg yolks were not a part of the designation, hollandaise).  Davidson also quotes from Harold McGee (1990), who explains that eggs are not needed at all and proper emulsification can simply be created with butter. He also states that if one does wish to use eggs they are not needed in so great a quantity as normally called for in traditional recipes. [PAR] The sauce using egg yolks and butter appeared in the 19th century. Although various sources say it was first known as ""sauce Isigny"" (a town in Normandy said to have been renowned for the quality of its butter), Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management has recipes in the first edition (1861) for ""Dutch sauce, for fish""Beeton, Isabella. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, p.405. and its variant on the following page, ""Green sauce, or Hollandaise verte"". Her directions for hollandaise were to ""[p]ut all the ingredients, except the lemon-juice, into a stew-pan; set it over the fire, and keep continually stirring. When it is sufficiently thick, take it off, as it should not boil...""Beeton, Isabella. Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management, p.406. [PAR] Preparation  [PAR]   [PAR] Hollandaise requires some skill and practice to prepare and hold. Properly made, it will be smooth and creamy with no hint of separation. The flavor will be rich and buttery, with a mild tang from the flavorants (e.g. lemon juice). It is best prepared and served warm, but not hot.  There are several methods for preparing a hollandaise sauce. All preparation methods require near-constant agitation, usually with a wire whisk. [PAR] One family of methods involves acidifying the egg yolks to aid in the formation of an emulsion, either with lemon juice or vinegar. Escoffier  uses a reduction of vinegar and water. Others   use lemon juice or sherry.  The acidified yolks are whisked gently over simmering water  until they thicken and lighten in color (144 °F/62 °C). Then, as with a mayonnaise,  the emulsion is formed by slowly whisking melted butter into it. Use of clarified butter is common. Some varieties of this preparation use water of various volumes and temperatures. [PAR] Alton Brown espouses quite a different method.  The yolks, without acid, are cooked as above.

"[DOC] [TLE] Egon Spengler - Ghostbusters Wiki - WikiaEgon Spengler | Ghostbusters Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia [PAR] Edit [PAR] Egon is hard-working and constantly focused on the paranormal activity of New York. His life revolves around scientific study, in general as well as on ghosts. In his spare time, he collects spores, molds, and fungus. He doesn't articulate his emotions well and has described himself as ""always serious."" His childhood may have not been a very happy one, as is suggested his parents were emotionally neglectful; Egon once shared with Ray that they ""did not believe in toys""; he described Oscar's playroom as ""very cheerful"" in a tone that suggested he was aware he missed out on something nice. His parents gave him part of a Slinky once, and he straightened it. Once, during the Vigo incident , Egon flatly informed  Mayor Lenny 's porter that the Proton Pack was not a toy. Despite Janine Melnitz ' hints that she was attracted to him, he seemed to ignore her romantic advances, kept quiet, and their relationship remained platonic. However, even though Egon admitted when he was terrified at the sight of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, he stayed with the others, showing bravery and a cool head even in the face of doom. It was his idea to cross the streams, which ultimately saved the world. Egon also has a dead-pan sense of humor and has been known to be sly, such as after the Ghostbusters' first case, he discretely holds up his fingers to show Peter the amount the Sedgewick Hotel will be billed. [PAR] Egon has a very dry sense of humor, once jokingly stating that most women would be ""more interested in his epididymis,"" rather than his intellect. He is not immune to anger, as under duress he has been shown to swear twice during the Gozer incident . He even lunged at Walter Peck in anger when Peck ordered them arrested for the disruption regarding the shutdown of the containment grid , despite the fact Peck himself was entirely responsible, and ignored Egon's repeated explanation of why it would be so dangerous to do so. After the Ghostbusters narrowly escaped from Shandor Island, Ray began enthusiastically asking how it was and if they seen anything cool, Egon simply told him to ""Shut up."" [PAR] Egon does, on occasion, smirk and give a wisecrack; such as during their encounter with the Opera Diva ghost during the Shandor incident Egon says ""The fat lady's singing!"" And while exploring Central Park's Cult Cemetery , Peter says ""This isn't the Central Park I'm used to."" to which Egon replies, ""You still have your wallet?"" Generally though, Egon remains largely pragmatic with a straight-to-the-point demeanor. [PAR] Egon puts few restraints on the scope of his paranormal research. This is evident shortly after Dana Barrett's First Avenue incident, as he conducts experiments in his lab in which he deliberately incites couples to argue. When Egon and Ray discover the Psychomagnotheric Slime , aka ""mood slime"", he and Ray perform various tests themselves, including shouting verbal abuse at it, singing to it, saying sweet, nurturing things to it, and Egon even sleeps with it to learn its' response. His efforts, and arguably sacrificing a personal life, pay off, as it his theories and decisions from clear-thinking, that ultimately save his friends multiple times. [PAR] History [PAR] Edit [PAR] Egon was very interested in paranormal phenomenon, even while working with Ray Stantz and Peter Venkman at the University. He and Ray Stantz studied paranormal literature in their spare time and were interested in theories of reincarnation. [PAR] Egon was usually the first to interview case subjects, adding to their mantra, ""we're ready to believe you."" Examples were Dana Barrett from her Zuul encounter and her carriage phenomenon with Oscar . Even people Peter called ""schizo"" always went to either Egon or Ray to describe their paranormal experiences, no matter how far-fetched their stories were.

"[DOC] [TLE] PBS - THE WEST - William F. CodyPBS - THE WEST - William F. Cody [PAR] ""Buffalo Bill"" [PAR] (1846-1917) [PAR] In a life that was part legend and part fabrication, William F. Cody came to embody the spirit of the West for millions, transmuting his own experience into a national myth of frontier life that still endures today. [PAR] Born in Scott County, Iowa, in 1846, Cody grew up on the prairie. When his father died in 1857, his mother moved to Kansas, where Cody worked for a wagon-freight company as a mounted messenger and wrangler. In 1859 , he tried his luck as a prospector in the Pikes Peak gold rush, and the next year, joined the Pony Express, which had advertised for ""skinny, expert riders willing to risk death daily."" Already a seasoned plainsman at age 14, Cody fit the bill. [PAR] During the Civil War, Cody served first as a Union scout in campaigns against the Kiowa and Comanche, then in 1863 he enlisted with the Seventh Kansas Cavalry, which saw action in Missouri and Tennessee. After the war, he married Louisa Frederici in St. Louis and continued to work for the Army as a scout and dispatch carrier, operating out of Fort Ellsworth, Kansas. [PAR] Finally, in 1867, Cody took up the trade that gave him his nickname, hunting buffalo to feed the construction crews of the Kansas Pacific Railroad. By his own count, he killed 4,280 head of buffalo in seventeen months. He is supposed to have won the name ""Buffalo Bill"" in an eight-hour shooting match with a hunter named William Comstock, presumably to determine which of the two Buffalo Billï¿½s deserved the title. [PAR] Beginning in 1868, Cody returned to his work for the Army. He was chief of scouts for the Fifth Cavalry and took part in 16 battles, including the Cheyenne defeat at Summit Springs, Colorado, in 1869. For his service over these years, he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1872, although this award was revoked in 1916 on the grounds that Cody was not a regular member of the armed forces at the time. (The award was restored posthumously in 1989). [PAR] All the while Cody was earning a reputation for skill and bravery in real life, he was also becoming a national folk hero, thanks to the exploits of his alter ego, ""Buffalo Bill,"" in the dime novels of Ned Buntline (pen name of the writer E. Z. C. Judson). Beginning in 1869, Buntline created a Buffalo Bill who ranked with Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone and Kit Carson in the popular imagination, and who was, like them, a mixture of incredible fact and romantic fiction. [PAR] In 1872 Buntline persuaded Cody to assume this role on stage by starring in his play, The Scouts of the Plains, and though Cody was never a polished actor, he proved a natural showman, winning enthusiastic applause for his good-humored self-portrayal. Despite a falling out with Buntline, Cody remained an actor for eleven seasons, and became an author as well, producing the first edition of his autobiography in 1879 and publishing a number of his own Buffalo Bill dime novels. Eventually, there would be some 1,700 of these frontier tales, the majority written by Prentiss Ingraham. [PAR] But not even show business success could keep Cody from returning to the West. Between theater seasons, he regularly escorted rich Easterners and European nobility on Western hunting expeditions, and in 1876 he was called back to service as an army scout in the campaign that followed Custer ï¿½s defeat at the Little Bighorn . [PAR] On this occasion, Cody added a new chapter to his legend in a ""duel"" with the Cheyenne chief Yellow Hair, whom he supposedly first shot with a rifle, then stabbed in the heart and finally scalped ""in about five seconds,"" according to his own account. Others described the encounter as hand-to-hand combat, and misreported the chiefï¿½s name as Yellow Hand. Still others said that Cody merely lifted the chiefï¿½s scalp after he had died in battle.

Originally created by Young as a series of stories to help his son overcome his fear of the dark, SuperTed became a popular series of books and led to an animated series produced from 1983 to 1985.  An American-produced series, The Further Adventures of SuperTed, was produced by Hanna Barbera in 1989. A modern reboot of the series is currently being developed by Young. It has also aired twice in Australia on ABC and first aired every Saturday morning on 3 May 1986 and then went to air weekday afternoons on 27 April 1987 and continued airing (along with its American sequel) until 13 May 1997. [PAR] Creation [PAR] ""SuperTed"" was created by Mike Young in 1978  for his son to help him overcome his fear of the dark. Later Mike decided to put the stories into book form.

After a while, Mike started to write actual story books about SuperTed. Then after some unsuccessful attempts, he was able to get his book published by a local printer. This led Mike to a successful career, writing and publishing over 100 SuperTed books, with illustrations done by Philip Watkins, until 1990. Just after his first book was published, his wife suggested he should produce a stuffed toy version of SuperTed, which was done in 1980.  [PAR] The process also drew the attention of Warner Brothers, who in 1980 made an offer of £250,000 for the film rights. Mike was determined to keep SuperTed Welsh,   as he wanted to help create local jobs and prove that places outside London had talent.  In 1981, S4C enquired about making SuperTed into animations, but Mike decided to create Siriol Productions to produce the series himself.  Siriol management wished to create SuperTed in a way which their own kids could be proud of, free from facile plots and hard-line violence.  This concept continued to be adopted in all series made by Siriol, which proves that ""soft edge and quality animation can be more appealing to children than any amount of violence"". Superted was also turned into a stage show. Melvyn Hayes reprised his role but other parts were taken by other actors.

Spotty then brings the now living teddy bear to Mother Nature, who gives the bear special powers, transforming him into SuperTed. Whenever trouble arises, SuperTed whispers his ""secret magic word"" and transforms into a superhero adorned with a red suit, cape and rocket boots. As SuperTed and Spotty travel across the world, and sometimes even space, to help others in need, they find themselves up against the nefarious and greedy cowboy, Texas Pete, and his two henchmen; the overweight and bumbling Bulk and the cowardly and effeminate Skeleton, as he seeks to either rule the world or increase his own wealth.

The prince’s dissolute lifestyle, links to unsavory foreign potentates, and friendship with the American registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are undercutting the Queen’s efforts to rehabilitate the monarchy. And while many blame Andrew’s problems on his perennially broke ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, Edward Klein discovers some insiders pointing to another woman—his mother herself. [PAR] by [PAR] Twitter [PAR] HEIR AND A SPARE Prince Andrew and Prince Charles arrive in a carriage at the Royal Ascot horse race, 2006. By David Hartley/Rex USA. [PAR] On a snowy Friday afternoon last February, Ed Perkins received an urgent phone call in his ground-floor office at Buckingham Palace. Perkins has the thankless task of serving as press secretary to the Queen’s wayward second son, His Royal Highness Prince Andrew, Duke of York. The female voice on the other end of the phone line belonged to Sian James, an assistant editor at The Mail on Sunday, a tabloid that’s been unsparing in its coverage of Andrew’s dissolute private life and dodgy friends. [PAR] “We’re planning to publish a story about the Duke of York,” James told Perkins, “and we’d like a comment from the Palace.” [PAR] Perkins listened in stunned silence as James unfolded a shocking tale. Her newspaper had obtained an interview with a young woman named Virginia Roberts, who claimed that the billionaire American money manager Jeffrey Epstein had trained her as an under-age prostitute and flown her to London in 2001, when she was just 17 years old, for the express purpose of spending time with Prince Andrew. Virginia, now a mother of three living in Australia, had waited a decade to break her silence, but the newspaper had evidence to support her story—flight logs from Epstein’s Boeing 727 and Gulfstream jet, and a photo showing Prince Andrew with his arm around Virginia’s bare midriff. Standing off to one side in the photo was Ghislaine Maxwell, 49, the stylish and well-connected daughter of the late, disgraced British newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell. According to Virginia, Ghislaine recruited her as Epstein’s “sex slave” when she was 15 years old and arranged for her to see Andrew three times, in London and New York and on Epstein’s private Caribbean island, Little Saint James. She said she’d been “sexually exploited by Epstein’s adult male peers, including royalty.” (Prince Andrew denied that he had had sexual contact with Roberts or any other of Epstein’s girls. Ghislaine Maxwell also denies the allegations and says that she plans to take legal action against a number of British newspapers.)

Ariel's character is very likeable as she is given a chance to have legs and fall in love with a prince. Sure, the idea is as old as the hills, but when it's done right, time never makes a difference. ""The Little Marmaid"" is a classic tale that will never get old, but it's not one of their efforts that will stay in my heart. It's fun and then it's over. There is not much to this one, but it's very likeable! [PAR] KJ Proulx [PAR] Super Reviewer [PAR] The Little Mermaid is a good animated film, but compared to many previous Disney features, this film isn't as memorable. Of course this is a good film that is a must watch for the entire family, however I think that it's pretty far from the first few Disney classics that put Disney on the map. Although very entertaining, The Little Mermaid does not belong among the greatest films in Disney's history. Despite this, the film is still worth watching and is lots of fun. I don't view it as an all time classic, but it does manage to bring back elements of some Disney classics. Compared to others in Disney's repertoire, The Little Mermaid is fairly average. Nonetheless if you're a fan of animated flicks, then watch this one. The film has a story everyone will enjoy no matter what age you are. A fun filled film with a good voice cast; this is a film that conveys old school ideas with a modern twist. If you love Disney's other films, and then give this one a view. The film may not be as great as the classics such as Snow White, but it still is entertaining and fun for the entire family. As a whole, The Little Mermaid is a good film, but like I said isn't the best film in Disney's catalogue. For me personally, I much prefer the older Disney classics. Despite this, I still recommend this film. Entertaining, and lots of fun for people of all ages. A very good animated film, just not in the same category as other Disney films. I still think that The Lion King is the best Disney flick that stands among the traditional Disney classics.

Camp Hill was formally opened by Winston Churchill. [PAR] In a report in April 2007, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised Camp Hill for its lack of a coherent and positive direction, and its failure to improve. Concerns were also raised at the amount of inmates not in vocational work at the prison.  Camp Hill courted controversy again weeks later, when it emerged an arsonist had been mistakenly released 29 months too early from the prison.  [PAR] In January 2008 a convicted drug dealer refused to leave his cell in Camp Hill for a court appearance. Citing the 1998 Human Rights Act, the prisoner claimed his human rights would be breached if he was forced to leave, due to fears he would lose his cell to another inmate amid an overcrowding crisis at Camp Hill.  [PAR] In October 2008, it was announced that the name Camphill could be lost, along with the two other prison names, Albany and Parkhurst. The three would become part of one large prison run by a single governor. New names for the larger single prison have been suggested as HMP Solent, HMP Mountbatten and HMP Vectis.  HMP Isle of Wight was later selected as the new name for the super prison incorporating all three island prisons.

The town is situated slightly to the north of the centre of the Island, at the head of the navigable section of the River Medina, which flows northward to Cowes and the Solent, and on which the town has a quay. [PAR] History [PAR] Mousterian remains, featuring tools made by Neanderthals at least 40,000 years ago, were found at Great Pan Farm in the 1970s.  [PAR] There are signs of Roman settlement in the area, which was probably known as Medina, including two known Roman villas, one of which, Newport Roman Villa, has been excavated and is open to the public.  [PAR] Information about the area resumes after the Norman Conquest. The first charter was granted in the late 12th century. In 1377 an invading French force burnt down much of the town while attempting to take Carisbrooke Castle, then under the command of Sir Hugh Tyrill. A group of Frenchmen were captured and killed, then buried in a tumulus later nicknamed Noddies Hill, a ""noddy"" being medieval slang for a body. This was later corrupted to Nodehill, the present-day name for a part of central Newport – a name confusing to many as the area is flat.  [PAR] In 1648 Charles I and a group of Parliamentary Commissioners concluded the Treaty of Newport, an attempt at reaching a compromise in the Civil War, undermined by Charles's negotiations with the French and Scots to intervene on his behalf. The Treaty was repudiated by Oliver Cromwell upon returning from defeating the Scots at the Battle of Preston. This led to Charles's execution.

Some seasons though, espadrilles gain momentum and become more fashionable, like they are doing for Spring and Summer 2015. This was not a trend that I forecasted or expected to see, so it’s been fun being caught by surprise.  [PAR] There is a vast assortment of espadrille styles this season, taking the classic to a new level. The original espadrille  was flat with a cotton or canvas upper and jute rope sole and heel. The classic style is still widely available, but there are many variations on the theme. The uppers can be made of leather, pleather or plastic. They can also be colour blocked, patterned, embroidered and perforated. Some flat styles have been cut into sandal silhouettes with ankle straps, or cut away like d’Orsay styles. Hybrid espadrilles with flat platforms and Birkenstock or sneaker uppers make for interesting combinations.  [PAR] Espadrilles with jute rope wedge heels are also popular, and have become another classic. Heel heights vary, as does the style, material, colour and pattern of the upper. Vamps are both high and low. Elastic inserts make for an extra comfortable fit. To my eye, the options in colours and patterns are just as great as the ones in neutrals. [PAR] 4 [PAR] Espadrilles have their fab and not so fab qualities.

The flat style is much like wearing a casual loafer whereas the heeled rendition is more like wearing a casual wedge sandal. The flats look great with shorts outfits because the bare exposure of the leg elongates the leg line which offsets the stumpy integrity of the flat and high-vamped ped.

""Sweet About Me"" was written after Cilmi was pillaging a Parisian record store for inspiration.  Cilmi was listening to early psychedelic music around the time when she wrote the song.  Lyrically, Cilmi said that the song is saying, ""We're all going to make mistakes, so we might as well have fun while we're making them."" Cilmi explained ""Sweet About Me"" to Bob Henderson of Gay Times, ""['Sweet About Me' is about] nothing being what it seems.

[PAR] The coconut palm is economically important to many developing countries. [PAR] Members of the family Arecaceae, palm trees are an ancient and diverse group of trees that bear fruit containing one or multiple seeds. Many of these fruits are hard or tough and suitable for consumption only by wildlife, such as birds and squirrels. However, a number of palms produce fruit that is good for human consumption or useful for other commercial purposes. [PAR] Coconut Palm [PAR] The coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) is a tall, tropical tree that grows well in U. S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 10b to 11. The fruit of the coconut palm consists of a fibrous, hard seed coat surrounding a large, edible seed or nut. The highly nutritious nutmeat has many culinary uses and can also be pressed to produce coconut milk. Coconut oil, an edible semi-solid fat extracted from the nutmeat, is used in chocolate and ice cream, as well as products such as soap, hair conditioner, ointments, lubricants, rubber and paint. [PAR] Date Palm [PAR] Members of the genus Phoenix, date palms range in height from 10 feet to more than 80 feet, depending on the species. Female date palms bear fruit if a male tree is nearby, but not all species bear fruit that is good for human consumption. The main trees used for commercial date production are the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) and the silver date palm (Phoenix sylvestris), both of which grow in USDA zones 9 to 11. Dates are grown commercially throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa and also southern California and Arizona. Many types of date trees are grown as ornamental landscape plants throughout the southeastern and southwestern United States. [PAR] Jelly Palm [PAR] The jelly palm (Butia capitata) is a cold-hardy, small to medium-sized tree with long feathery leaves. It produces clusters of small edible yellowish-orange fruit. The fruit is sweet, but somewhat tart and fibrous and is often used to make jelly. Native to South America, the jelly palm tolerates occasional winter lows to 15 degrees Fahrenheit and grows well in USDA zones 8 to 9. [PAR] Chilean Wine Palm [PAR] The Chilean wine palm (Jubaea chilensis) grows approximately 80 feet tall with a thick, sturdy trunk. This palm bears small orange fruits that contain brown hollow seeds about 2 inches in diameter. These seeds look and taste similar coconuts. The tree also produces a sugary sap that can be boiled down to make syrup or fermented to make wine. However, extracting the sap eventually kills the tree. The Chilean wine palm prefers cooler temperate areas and grows well in USDA zones 8 to 10. [PAR] Guadalupe Palm [PAR] The Guadalupe palm (Brahea edulis) prefers sunny Mediterranean climates and is hardy to 20 F. This tree is native to Guadalupe Island, a small volcanic island off the western coast of Mexico. The Guadalupe palm bears small fleshy fruit, similar in taste and texture to a date. The fruit is often used for making jelly and jam. This tree reaches about 30 feet tall in USDA zones 9a to 11. [PAR] Sunset Western Garden Book; Kathleen Norris Brenzel, ed.

"[DOC] [TLE] Ashok India :: PistachiosAshok India ::  Pistachios [PAR] Contact Us [PAR] History Of Pistachios: [PAR] Unquestionably one of the earliest authenticated historical records of any edible nuts is the Pistachio. Carbonised pistachio remains have dated back as early as 6760 B.C. from the early Neolithic settlement in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. In early times pistachios were regarded as a food for the wealthy and privileged. Although the pistachio tree has been known throughout recorded history, its place of origin is uncertain. It is probably native to western Asia and Asia Minor, but is found growing wild eastward as far as Pakistan and India . According to Pliny, the pistachio was introduced to Italy from Syria during the reign of Tiberius, early in the first century A.D. Subsequently, its cultivation spread to other Mediterranean countries. [PAR] The Pistachio Tree [PAR] The pistachio tree is a deciduous tree, which grows slowly to a height and spread of twenty-five to thirty feet. It can survive under dry, adverse conditions in poor, stony terrain where for most of the year there may be no rainfall. It can grow well on steep, rocky slopes suitable only for goats; it can endure drought as well. It thrives in areas, which have winters cool enough to break bud dormancy and hot long summers. The tree is resistant to cold and wind but cannot tolerate excessive dampness and high humidity. It flourishes in some regions of Iran where temperatures vary from over 100 degrees in the summer to 15 degrees in the winter. [PAR] Sometimes known as the ""pistache"", the pistachio differs from other popular dessert nuts in the characteristic green of its kernel. This coloration, which varies from yellowish through various shades of green, is not limited to the surface but extends throughout the kernel. In general, the deeper the shades of green, the more the nuts are esteemed. The fruits grow in clusters resembling grapes. [PAR] Although popularly known as a nut, the fruit of the pistachio is classified botanical as a drupe, the edible portion of which is the seed. This oblong kernel about one inch in length and one-half in diameter is protected somewhat from dust, dirt and other impurities by a thin, ivory-coloured, bony shell. When conditions are favourable, the shells split open just prior to harvest and have an appearance of a laughing face. [PAR] Pistachio Producing Areas: [PAR] The world's major pistachio producing areas are Iran , Turkey , and the San Joaquin Valley of California. Due to the tough trade regulations with Iran , it is near impossible to find the Iranian variety in the United States . There is an import tax upwards of three hundred percent of the value of the pistachios to import Iranian pistachios. Today, Turkey is the main supplier of imported pistachios in the United States . Most of the Turkish production comes from the dry, barren foothills of western and south-eastern Turkey , principally from the regions of Gaziantep and Urfa . [PAR] Harvesting Pistachios: [PAR] During harvest, the shells often become stained and blemished. Unless camouflaged, the pistachios appear unappetising. United States importers sometimes employ a non-toxic red vegetable dye to give the nuts visual appeal. The red colour serves another purpose as well, since it appeals to consumers who are used to it and demand it. In California , however, pistachios are mechanically hulled and dried and most are not coloured and left in the unblemished, natural state. [PAR] There is considerable controversy concerning the merits of home-grown versus imported pistachios. The American importers of Turkish and Iranian pistachios describe the California counterparts as beautiful but tasteless. The California producers claim their pistachio taste about the same but are larger, fresher and easier to open. California is the only state, which produces pistachios on a commercial scale. Most of the production comes from the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys , although some small acreage has been planted in the California desert near Barstow and Mojave, as well as in other parts of the state. Under favourable conditions a pistachio tree can live and produce for centuries. [PAR] When ripe, the pistachio tree is shaken and the nuts fall to the ground to be harvested. Following harvest, the nuts must be hulled",Half the world's pistachio nuts are grown in which country?,['iran'],b7d9957123cd4fcc96ce83addbbf1e9a,"[{'end': [1460, 2574, 2476], 'start': [1457, 2571, 2473]}]",∃x (Country(x) ∧ GrowsHalfOfPistachios(x))

"[DOC] [TLE] Saint LuciaSaint Lucia (; ) is a sovereign island country in the eastern Caribbean Sea on the boundary with the Atlantic Ocean. Part of the Lesser Antilles, it is located north/northeast of the island of Saint Vincent, northwest of Barbados and south of Martinique. It covers a land area of 617 km2 (238.23 sq mi) and has a population of 174,000 (2010). Its capital is Castries. [PAR] The French were the island's first European settlers. They signed a treaty with the native Carib Indians in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France 14 times, and rule of the island changed frequently (it was seven times each ruled by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the ""Helen of the West Indies"". [PAR] Representative government came about in 1840 (with universal suffrage from 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the Federation of the West Indies. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state of the Commonwealth of Nations associated with the United Kingdom.  Saint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction,  meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both the civil law and English common law. The Civil Code of St. Lucia of 1867 was based on the  Quebec Civil Code of 1866, as supplemented by English common law-style legislation. It is also a member of La Francophonie.  [PAR] Etymology [PAR] One of the Windward Islands, Saint Lucia was named after Saint Lucy of Syracuse by the French, the island's first European settlers, and the only country in the world named after a woman.  [PAR] History [PAR] The French pirate François le Clerc (also known as Jambe de Bois, due to his wooden leg) frequently visited Saint Lucia in the 1550s. It was not until around 1600 that the first European camp was started by the Dutch at what is now Vieux Fort. In 1605 an English vessel called the Olive Branch was blown off-course on its way to Guyana, and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia. After five weeks only 19 survived due to disease and conflict with the Caribs, so they fled the island. The French officially claimed the island in 1635. The English attempted the next European settlement in 1639, and that too was wiped out by Caribs. [PAR] French colony [PAR] In 1643 a French expedition sent out from Martinique established a permanent settlement on the island. De Rousselan was appointed the island's governor, took a Carib wife and remained in post until his death in 1654. [PAR] In 1664, Thomas Warner (son of Sir Thomas Warner, the governor of St. Kitts) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666 the French West India Company resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Lucia.html World Statesmen: Saint Lucia Chronology] Linked 2014-01-20 [PAR] 18th and 19th century [PAR] Both the British and the French found the island attractive after the sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century. [PAR] In 1722, George I of Great Britain granted both Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent to John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu. He in turn appointed Nathaniel Uring, a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.  [PAR] During the Seven Years' War Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year.

Around the state, they’ll gather for informal games and in structured contests on official playing fields, umpire and all. The sport they’ll play? Cricket, the only sport in the world where you can be out for a duck if a bowler you thought was a dibbly dobbly sends you a googly. [PAR] You may chortle a bit at this stereotypically British athletic contest that comes complete with an official tea break, but more than 1,000 people play the sport in Virginia, according to Shelton Glasgow, the Atlantic region representative to the United States of America Cricket Association. Northern Virginia in particular has seen a surge in the number of active cricket players—Loudoun County conducts a popular cricket league, and some public schools in Fairfax County include cricket in physical education classes. Cricket is even played on the collegiate level: The George Mason University cricket team beat 31 squads to win the 2011 national championship. [PAR] Cricket began in England, with the earliest known reference to the game dating to 1598. (The game would be codified in 1788.) Long associated with countries that were once part of the British Empire, it’s no surprise the sport was played in Colonial Virginia. The 1709 and 1710 secret diaries of William Byrd of Westover indicate that Byrd played cricket with friends at Westover, Green Spring, Shirley and Berkeley plantations, and played hard enough to injure himself. “We played at cricket and I sprained my backside,” he wrote, but continued to play. [PAR] During the Revolutionary War, George Washington’s troops are thought to have played a variation of the game at Valley Forge in 1778. Even post-Independence, in 1795, a Richmond cricket club printed a set of team and sport rules, suggesting the organization’s members wanted more people to take up the pastime. [PAR] Henry Chadwick, now rememberd as “the father of baseball,” was initially a cricket writer and created a short-lived Richmond cricket club in 1857, and there are references to clubs in Roanoke, Gordonsville, Charlottesville and Richmond around the turn of the century. But it was baseball that captured Chadwick’s imagination, along with the rest of the nation’s. [PAR] Cricket was largely forgotten, but far from gone. The British Commonwealth Cricket Club, established in 1953 and now based in Washington, D.C., played its first four years in Virginia at Bellpais, a Fairfax County estate near Mount Vernon. The organization served as the fountainhead for the multiethnic Washington Cricket League and the melting-pot cricket culture that began to emerge across Northern Virginia. In 1988, the Hampton Cricket Club emerged from the gathering of NATO troops stationed in the area. A few years later, the India Association Cricket Club took up play in Richmond, taking on Hampton and another team in Lynchburg. In 1995, the four-squad Mid-Atlantic Cricket League formed, and the next year it merged into the North Carolina-based Mid-Atlantic Cricket Conference. Last year, 15 Virginia teams competed in the MACC. [PAR] Fans see cricket as a highly athletic sport. Top-level bowlers can hurl 100-mile-per-hour balls toward the batsman, who needs protective equipment, including arm, leg and chest guards, gloves, and a protective helmet with a facemask. The players wear collared shirts and brightly colored uniforms that almost resemble training suits for most matches.

It was the year that I graduated from high school and was about to embark on an incredible journey into adulthood by being the first member of my family to attend college. It was also the summer that one of the greatest series of that decade would premiere. The drama was The OC, and its soap opera-worthy storylines had everyone talking. Whether it was Marissa overdosing on pills in Mexico, or Ryan getting into another fight with Luke, The OC was the show that all people of all ages would watch and discuss and obsess over. The series would run for four seasons before finally get the axe in February 2007. Since then, a majority of the cast can still be found on your televisions today, and we are not talking about reruns. Here is a look at what the cast of The OC has been up to for the last eight years. [PAR] Ben McKenzie as Ryan Atwood [PAR] Ben McKenzie carried over his “tough guy” persona from The OC to his next television project that came out in 2009. McKenzie played Officer Ben Sherman for all five seasons of the gritty police drama Southland. The series originally aired on NBC but was cancelled due to the adult subject matter depicted in every episode. TNT quickly picked the series up and would air it for four more seasons. Following Southland‘s cancellation on TNT, it did not take McKenzie long to find his next project. In 2014, he began planning James Gordon on the popular FOX drama Gotham.  [PAR] Adam Brody as Seth Cohen [PAR] Adam Brody had quite an extensive resume prior to starring on The OC in 2003. He appeared on several MTV series, including Undressed and MTV’s Now What? before playing lovable misfit Seth Cohen. Brody would go on to appear in several less than stellar films once The OC ended in 2007, including Jennifer’s Body with Megan Fox and In the Land of Women alongside Meg Ryan and Kristen Stewart. In 2011, Brody returned to the small screen playing Woodie on the animated series Good Vibes. He would go on to star in the second season of the comedy Burning Love. His latest project, Billy & Billie, premiered on DirecTV. [PAR] Mischa Barton as Marissa Cooper [PAR] Mischa Barton played the very divisive Marissa Cooper throughout the first three seasons of The OC before Marissa tragically died in a car accident in the Season 3 finale. Since leaving the series, Barton has struggled to find success in other film and television projects, starring in the short-lived CW series The Beautiful Life: TBL and movies, such as Don’t Fade Away, A Resurrection, and L.A. Slasher. [PAR] Rachel Bilson as Summer Roberts [PAR] Rachel Bilson became one of the breakout stars of The OC, portraying the wildly popular (and quotable) Summer Roberts. After the series ended in 2007, Bilson guest starred in other popular series, such as Chuck and How I Met Your Mother, before landing the starring role in the CW’s Hart of Dixie, which premiered in 2011 and was produced by The OC creator Josh Schwartz and executive producer Stephanie Savage. Bilson has also appeared in films like Jumper, Waiting for Forever, and The To Do List.

The fortnightly children's nature programme was made by the fledgling Natural History Unit, and presented by Johnny Morris, who provided voices for the animals and made them talk. On the first show he interviewed a Woolly Monkey. Morris was occasionally criticised for anthropomorphising the animals, but the humour drew viewers into the more formal scientific elements of the programme. In the first edition these were provided by Tony Soper and Gerald Durrell.

After his radio debut in 1946, Johnny became a regular voice on BBC West Country radio throughout the 1950s, commentating on local events and presenting his regular show, Pass The Salt. [PAR] His first appearance on television was as The Hot Chestnut Man (1953-61), a short children's slot where, from behind his chestnut barrow, he told a humorous yarn in a thick West Country accent. In Tales of the Riverbank (1960) his talent for animal mimicry became apparent and in 1962 he was approached to present the new BBC children's show Animal Magic. [PAR] An instant hit, Animal Magic was a lively, action-packed animal spectacular. Combining knockabout clowning with a gentle knack for storytelling Johnny adopted the role of 'Zookeeper Morris'. Including inserts of him in character in Bristol Zoo and later in other zoos around the country, Johnny helped to feed, bathe and look after a whole host of animals, adding voices to the soundtrack to mimic their reactions. Johnny's appealing manner made a star not only out of himself but many of his creature companions, with Wendy the elephant, Congo the chimpanzee and Dotty the ring-tailed lemur shooting to fame alongside him. [PAR] Hugely popular, Animal Magic ran for over twenty years, and was credited with providing a whole generation with a keener understanding of animals, their needs and personalities. However it was finally abandoned in 1983, when its anthropomorphic approach was deemed out-dated. [PAR] In addition to Animal Magic Johnny also presented a variety of BBC travel programmes including Ticket to Turkey (1960), Johnny Morris in Mexico (1968) and Oh, to be in England (1976). In 1984 he was appointed OBE, but in the 1980s and 1990s his television appearances became less frequent. [PAR] In The Magic Keeper (1998), a short silent film shown on Channel 4, Johnny's zookeeper character appeared for the final time. He died in 1999 while working on a new animal series, ITV's Wild Thing, and was buried along with his zookeeper's cap.[DOC] [TLE] Naturalist who brought Animal Magic to millions - BBC NewsBBC News | Obituaries | Naturalist who brought Animal Magic to millions [PAR] Thursday, May 6, 1999 Published at 20:48 GMT 21:48 UK [PAR] Obituaries [PAR] Naturalist who brought Animal Magic to millions [PAR] Johnny Morris: Delighted generations of children [PAR] Johnny Morris, man of many voices, reporter, entertainer, was probably best known as the star of the television programme Animal Magic, which ran for 21 years and more than 400 editions.

Premier League clubs made 26 such signings in the January transfer window alone. [PAR] Marked man: Trevor Francis with his wife, Helen, and Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough at the City Ground after becoming Britain's most expensive player Photo: PA [PAR] By Simon Briggs [PAR] 7:30AM GMT 09 Feb 2009 [PAR] But when Trevor Francis became the first British player to break the seven-figure barrier, 30 years ago on Monday, it felt like the sporting equivalent of putting a man on the Moon. Nottingham Forest supplied the payment to Birmingham City. [PAR] Their initial outlay of £950,000 spiralled to £1.18 million with the addition of VAT and other sundries, though Brian Clough always claimed that the real figure was £999,999, out of concern for his new signing's state of mind. [PAR] He was right to be worried: Francis is still remembered as the man who went for a million, yet never quite lived up to his billing. [PAR] Technically, the deal was not a world record. Two Italian strikers – Giuseppe Savoldi and Paolo Rossi – had already cleared the two billion lire mark, which equated to well in excess of £1 million. [PAR] But Serie A was not then so well known in Britain as it is today, and the reporters who gathered around the signing ceremony on Feb 9, 1979, had a breathless sense of history in the making. [PAR] Related Articles [PAR] Delivering the goods [PAR] 08 Feb 2009 [PAR] Clough, typically, put his own spin on events. He turned up in a bright red sports jacket, and with a squash racket in his hand, as if to suggest that his social life was far more important than this minor business formality. [PAR] His comments were perfunctory, and not especially complimentary, in true 'Ol' Big 'Ead' fashion. Before Francis's debut, Clough instructed him to ""just give the ball to John Robertson – he's a better player than you"". [PAR] Francis, not surprisingly, felt bemused by his lukewarm welcome. ""When I signed for Forest, they said provocatively to the press that they thought I had great potential!"" he would recall. [PAR] ""And they had just paid a million for me. I thought to myself, well, what can they get out of me that no one else has got?"" [PAR] The question was never fully answered. Francis went some way towards repaying Forest's investment when he broke through Malmo's tenacious defence with a diving header to win the 1979 European Cup final. [PAR] But Clough and his assistant Peter Taylor could never quite agree where Francis should play: up front with his back to goal, or breaking forward from the right side of midfield. In the end, the million-pound misfit was shuffled on to Manchester City for another hefty sum. [PAR] Francis was not alone in labouring under the weight of his giant price-tag, as the accompanying list should make clear. Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they sell for a record transfer fee. [PAR] Take Ian Rush's £3.2 million move to Juventus in 1987, which lasted just over a year, and spawned the deathless quote ""It was like living in a foreign country."" [PAR] Rush was thrown off balance by the warm embraces of the Juventus fans, and the equally intimate attentions of the local defenders. He suffered from acute homesickness, as did Paul Gascoigne at Lazio five years later. [PAR] Yet some of these players felt out of place without even leaving the country: just look at Stan Collymore in his time at Liverpool. [PAR] The ebbs and flows of football politics are reflected in the way the record has grown – stealthily at first, and then at a crazy gallop.

"[DOC] [TLE] Abdominal thrustsAbdominal thrusts (also called the Heimlich maneuver or Heimlich manoeuvre) is a first aid procedure used to treat upper airway obstructions (or choking) by foreign objects. The term Heimlich maneuver is named after Dr. Henry Heimlich, who first described it in 1974.  [PAR] Performing abdominal thrusts involves a rescuer standing behind a patient and using his or her hands to exert pressure on the bottom of the diaphragm. This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on any object lodged in the trachea, hopefully expelling it. [PAR] Most modern protocols, including those of the American Heart Association, American Red Cross and the European Resuscitation Council, recommend several stages for airway obstructions, designed to apply increasingly more pressure. Most protocols recommend encouraging the victim to cough, followed by hard back slaps, and finally abdominal thrusts or chest thrusts as a last resort. Some guidelines also recommend alternating between abdominal thrusts and back slaps.[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/first-aid/FA00064 Foreign object inhaled: First aid], Mayo Clinic staff, Nov. 1, 2011. [PAR] History  [PAR] Henry Heimlich, noted for promulgating abdominal thrusts, claimed that back slaps were proven to cause death by lodging foreign objects into the windpipe.  The 1982 Yale study by Day, DuBois, and Crelin that persuaded the American Heart Association to stop recommending back blows for dealing with choking was partially funded by Heimlich's own foundation.  According to Roger White MD of the Mayo Clinic and American Heart Association (AHA), ""There was never any science here. Heimlich overpowered science all along the way with his slick tactics and intimidation, and everyone, including us at the AHA, caved in.""  [PAR] From 1985 to 2005, abdominal thrusts were the only recommended treatment for choking in the published guidelines of the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross. In 2006, both organizations drastically changed course and ""downgraded"" the use of the technique. For conscious victims, the new guidelines recommend first applying back slaps; if this method failed to remove the airway obstruction, rescuers were to then apply abdominal thrusts. For unconscious victims, the new guidelines recommend chest thrusts. [PAR] The European Resuscitation Council and the Mayo Clinic recommend alternating between five back slaps and five abdominal thrusts in cases of severe airway obstructions. [PAR] In some areas, such as Australia, authorities believe that there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of abdominal thrusts and their use is not recommended in first aid. Instead, chest thrusts are recommended.  [PAR] Henry Heimlich also promoted abdominal thrusts as a treatment for drowning  and asthma  attacks. The Red Cross now contests his claims that the maneuver could help drowning victims or someone suffering an asthma attack. The Heimlich Institute has stopped advocating on their website for the Heimlich maneuver to be used as a first aid measure for drowning victims. His son, Peter M. Heimlich, alleges that in August 1974 his father published the first of a series of fraudulent case reports in order to promote the use of abdominal thrusts for near-drowning rescue.   The 2005 drowning rescue guidelines of the American Heart Association did not include citations of Heimlich's work, and warned against the use of the Heimlich maneuver for drowning rescue as unproven and dangerous, due to its risk of vomiting leading to aspiration. [PAR] In May 2016 it was reported that Henry Heimlich had used the maneuver for the first time, saving the life of a fellow resident at his retirement home in Cincinnati.  [PAR] Universal sign of choking [PAR] A choking victim is usually unable to speak, and may not be able to make much sound at all. A universal sign of choking has been designated as a silent indication from a person who is unable to breathe, and consists of placing both hands on one's own throat while trying to attract the attention of others who might assist.  [PAR] Technique  [PAR] Performing abdominal thrusts involves a rescuer standing behind an upright patient and using his or her hands to exert pressure on the bottom of the diaphragm. This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on any object lodged in the trachea, hopefully expelling it.  This amounts to an artificially induced cough.  For example, WebMD recommends the rescuer","What name is given to abdominal thrusts performed on a choking victim, which is named after the American physician to whom it is credited?","['abdominal thrust', 'heimlich maneuver', 'heimlich manoeuvre']",33aa1501c5f5495b90e3a1a477045ddd,"[{'end': [80, 228, 3042, 3469], 'start': [64, 212, 3026, 3453]}, {'end': [102], 'start': [85]}]","∃x (Name(x, ""Heimlich maneuver"") ∧ CreditedTo(x, ""American physician""))"
"[DOC] [TLE] Crazy GangThe Crazy Gang is a nickname used by the English media to describe Wimbledon F.C. during the 1980s and 90s. The name, originally that of a well known group of British comedy entertainers popular in the late 1930s, was used because of the often cheeky and boisterously macho-behaviour of Wimbledon's players, who were in the habit of playing frequent and outrageous practical jokes on each other and on the club's manager Dave Bassett. Their general approach to the game was derided as amateurish and their playing style was often accused of being basic and unsophisticated in comparison to the stylish brand of football played by most leading clubs at the time. The then England striker Gary Lineker once commented dismissively: ""The best way to watch Wimbledon is on Ceefax"".  [PAR] Regardless of the criticism they were subject to, the team was very successful in the English league for more than a decade. The joking behaviour, together with a deep sense of being unjustly derided, bred an intensely close team spirit which was greatly to the club's benefit on the pitch. Their physical style, with players such as Vinnie Jones, often intimidated their opponents. Within only a few years, they had won promotion from the bottom of the Football League to the highest level, without ever changing their straightforward playing style. [PAR] History [PAR] Although the club had encouraged its players in this behaviour since the early 1980s, the nickname did not really become widespread in use, beyond the players of the club themselves, until 1988 when, against all expectations, Wimbledon won the FA Cup by beating highly talented favourites Liverpool FC 1-0, with goalkeeper Dave Beasant saving a penalty. At the final whistle, BBC TV commentator John Motson said the line: ""The Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club!"". The name then caught on nationally, began to appear frequently in newspaper reports, and was often used in TV coverage of the club. [PAR] It is difficult to determine precisely when the term fell out of use. However, as Wimbledon became more established in the top flight of English football after promotion in 1986, their style of play became more conventional, and their bizarre behaviour was no longer as unexpected. It can be said that the nickname lost much of its previous effect at the point it became official — when the club itself began to use it in its own marketing. This was carried to the extent that the name even appeared for several seasons in the mid-1990s as a small badge on the team's playing shirts. In 2000, the club was relegated from the Premier League after 14 years in the top flight, by which time the name had become rather inappropriate as a description of its players, although the club still continued to use it for some years to promote itself commercially. [PAR] Members [PAR] The likes of Dennis Wise, Mick Harford, John Fashanu, Vinnie Jones and Lawrie Sanchez are often considered to be some of the high profile members of the Crazy Gang, although the club's first ever full-time apprentice Wally Downes is normally cited as the founder, being an inveterate practical joker.[DOC] [TLE] London Football Club Guide - London Net - The Guide to ...London Football Club Guide [PAR] London Football Club Guide [PAR] Football Clubs A to Z [PAR] From Arsenal to Wycombe Wanderers [PAR] Other London Clubs [PAR] Barnet [PAR] Former owner Stan Flashman, a famous ticket tout, stumped up the cash that helped  the Bees gain league status in 1991.

"[DOC] [TLE] Vision OnVision On was a British children's television programme, shown on BBC1 from 1964 to 1976 and designed specifically for children with hearing impairment. [PAR] Concept and production [PAR] Vision On was conceived and developed by BBC producers Ursula Eason and Patrick Dowling to replace a monthly series For the Deaf, a programme paced slowly enough for children to read captions and subtitles. It was noted in surveys that a favourite for deaf children was Top of the Pops, due to its lively and fast-moving format and the fact that even the profoundly deaf could still enjoy the music's lower frequency notes. [PAR] There was initial disagreement as to whether lip-reading or British sign language would be more appropriate. Eventually it was decided that, since the new programme was intended as entertainment rather than education, communication would be entirely visual, the amount of text would be severely limited and, except for a few repeated statements, speech would be abandoned altogether. [PAR] The title Vision On referred to the illuminated sign in studios indicating that cameras were live. Normally another sign ""Sound On"" would follow, but the titles for Vision On deliberately omitted this. The programme's logo is made up from the words of the title and its reflection. [PAR] The aim of the programme was to entertain but also to encourage imagination, with a fast-paced flow of contrasting ideas, both sane and silly. This mixture was an apparent success as the series ran for twelve years and, while retaining a commitment to the deaf, attracted a wider following and gained several awards including the international Prix Jeunesse and the BAFTA Award for Specialised Programmes. [PAR] Presenters [PAR] A full list of contributors can be found,  but the main presenters were: [PAR] *Pat Keysell: an actress who also taught deaf children [PAR] *Tony Hart: artist, who made pictures in a variety of sizes and media, and encouraging children to submit their own paintings to ""The Gallery"", which they did in their thousands [PAR] *Ben Benison and Sylvester McCoy (credited as Sylveste McCoy): mime artistes [PAR] *Wilf Lunn: eccentric inventor of equally eccentric machines [PAR] *David Cleveland: appeared in film sequences as the Prof [PAR] Segments [PAR] Besides the scenes with Hart, Keysell and the others doing artwork (which in later years appeared on the screen as the artwork being made without any hands), Vision On had many memorable segments: [PAR] *""The Gallery"" – A section consisting of artwork sent into the show by viewers, with the name and age of the artist being shown alongside the artwork. Often the artwork shown on a specific show coincided with the theme of the show. At the end of this segment, Keysell would thank everyone for sending in their pictures and apologize for being unable to return them, but did state there was ""a prize for any that we show"". However, it remains unknown as to what exactly the prize was. [PAR] *""The Burbles"" – A couple of unseen people living inside a grandfather clock who converse in speech bubbles, mainly telling puns. Occasionally they are heard speaking the lines as if they are underwater, but other times there are just the speech bubbles. [PAR] *""The Prof"" – A man in a white lab coat (aka film-makers David Cleveland, Tony Amies and David Wyatt) who is usually outdoors doing various humorous things. [PAR] *""Humphrey the Tortoise"" – Much like the Burbles, Humphrey talks of something specific (usually a pun or joke) either to himself or someone else. His speech, as well as the other person's if there is one, is shown on screen with no audio. [PAR] *""The Digger"" – A ""cut-out"" cartoon man designed and animated by Bill Mather and George Dunning.

[PAR] But now Howard Brown, the bespectacled star of the Halifax television adverts, looks like being another victim of the credit crunch. [PAR] The bank has decided that in the current gloomy economic climate his adverts are too cheerful. [PAR] Since 2000 Mr Brown has fronted Halifax's adverts as part of the 'staff as stars' campaign. [PAR] Too upbeat: Howard Brown will no longer be the face of Halifax because it wants a more serious tone to reflect current economic problems [PAR] The commercials feature ordinary staff members performing song and dance routines with lyrics doctored to advertise Halifax products. [PAR] Even though they were routinely voted the most annoying adverts on TV, they, and Mr Brown, have endured. [PAR] Mr Brown, 42, who was originally a cashier at a branch in Sheldon near Birmingham, made his break singing a reworked version of Tom Jones' 'Sex Bomb'. [PAR] He appeared in seven more adverts for Halifax including singing 'I'll give you extra' to the tune of 'Angel' by pop star Shaggy. [PAR] Howard feels the crunch: Apparently surfing in a suit and riding a giant bird isn't quite so amusing in these tough financial times [PAR] In one bizarre advert he straddled a giant swan while in another he sent up Gene Kelly's 'Singing in the rain' umbrella dance routine. [PAR] He quickly became a household name and was turned into a waxwork model by Madame Tussauds. [PAR] Halifax had so much faith in their 'brand ambassador' they even turned him into a computer generated character to give the bank a friendlier image. [PAR] Now he is facing the sack after Halifax reviewed their advertising contract. [PAR] Even though the bank awarded it to the same agency that conjured the 'staff for stars' campaign, an internal review concluded its marketing should be more serious. [PAR] Ambassador: Mr Brown, 42, has been the face of the bank for eight years since winning a talent show among employees for the role [PAR] Dan Shute, the director of the Halifax account at DLKW, said: ""The financial world is very different in 2008 to the one that we started working with in the year 2000, so a change was necessary. [PAR] ""But it would be wrong to suggest that this is a reassurance campaign from Halifax - it's just recognising that times have changed."" [PAR] If the 'staff for stars' campaign is axed it throws into doubt the showbiz careers of other Halifax employees who have been catapulted to stardom.

Southampton would always let the players go back for the weekend when times were hard. [PAR] As well as forging their footballing skills, Southampton would train these young players and make them into men,               developing characters. Alan always had what you could call a ""positive"" approach to the game, and was never afraid to say what he thought, he was already a lot more mature than most of the boys there. [PAR] Alan met Lainya during his time at Southampton. They were both 17 years old at the time, and met in a pub one evening. At the time, Lainya was earning more  than Alan, so it's safe to say she didn't go for him because of the money. [PAR] In his very first season, Alan did well for the youth team, scoring loads of goals, and Dave Merrington tried to fit Alan in the first team after only 12               months, because he was ready for it ! But it wouldn't happen yet. Alan's second season at Southampton was a mixture between playing for the youth team and playing for the reserves. And one day, the               call-up came, 9th April 1988. Southampton striker Danny Wallace had failed a fitness test that morning and as Alan was having lunch around about 12.30PM, Chris Nicholl, the Southampton manager came and told him he was IN ! Alan came out on the pitch that afternoon and made a name for himself in front of the whole nation. He scored his first Senior goal after only 5 minutes ... and famously went on to score a HAT TRICK, he was only 17 years and 240 days old... [PAR] Alan's days as an apprentice were soon over after that, as he was called into Chris Nicholl's office a few days after the hat trick to sign his very first professional contract. Before long Alan and Lainya were living together in their own home. However Alan only played another 2 games after that in his debut season, not scoring any goals this time. [PAR] His second season wasn't prolific either,               still in the shadow of the first team regulars, Shearer only played 8 games without scoring any goals. His third year, 89-90, was much more encouraging, Alan scored in his first appearance of the season, coming on as a sub against QPR. And later went on to score 5 goals in total. In September 1990 Shearer               established himself in the first, this was his third season at the Dell. In all he               played over 45 games and scored 14 goals. International recognition               came along as well: Alan was picked for the England Under 21 side to play in the Toulon tournament, where England won in the Final against France, Alan scored. He also               picked the awards for top goal scorer and best player of the tournament. Shortly after that Lainya and Alan got married in Southampton. [PAR] 1991/1992 was to be Alan's final season at the Dell. Under new manager, Ian Branfoot, he ended as the club's leading scorer with 21 goals in all competitions, playing a staggering 60 games. He also               continued his good form for the Under 21s. But it wasn't long before he               just couldn't be ignored anymore by the full England setup. Graham Taylor played him in a friendly against France at Wembley, and Alan scored on his full international debut, to put his country on the way               to a 2-0 win. Taylor even selected Shearer in his squad for the Euro 92 finals in Sweden, but he only featured in one               group game - a goalless draw against France - and England were               eliminated at a disappointingly early stage.

[PAR] Twenty years ago this week, on September 19th, 1992, Filbert Fox made his first appearance ever as the Club’s new mascot. He was introduced to the Filbert Street crowd in the Division One (now Championship) game against Brentford, when he appeared on the pitch with ‘The Birch’ and Gary Lineker who were presenting a cheque for £5000 to the winner of the Club’s lottery. [PAR] Filbert was one of the first modern football mascots. He followed a tradition of earlier Leicester mascots which variously included small boys in schoolcaps with labels hung around their neck naming a favourite player, wooden cut-out figures held aloft on a pole and an elderly gentleman who wore a long coat and a blue and white top hat and who carried a blue and white walking stick( both of which can still be seen in the Reception Area of the Stadium).  [PAR] The Matchday Programme for the Brentford game featured the new mascot as its leading story. The first published words ever written about Filbert were, “Here’s the newest addition to the Filbert Street family. The new Leicester City Fox. And in ‘City Magazine’ we’re running a great competition to find a new name for our fox. All you have to do is come up with a winning name and you’ll win a Leicester City playing kit of your choice”.  In those pre-internet days, entries had to be dropped into the ‘special fox box’ in the Club Shop at Filbert Street. [PAR] The winning entry was announced in the programme for the game against Barnsley a couple of weeks later. Under the headline, ‘It’s Filbert the Fox’, it was announced that, ‘Our new Leicester City mascot has been christened Filbert the Fox..by popular demand.We received an overwhelming response to name the new Fox, and hundreds of you plumped for Filbert.We put all the entries for Filbert into a draw and the lucky winner was Mr T. Pearce’. [PAR] A wide range of names had been suggested. These included Septimus  (after the famous pre-war Leicester City player Sep Smith), Englebert, Felix, Fearless Fred, and Bluey  the Brush. Two entries paid tribute to manager Brian Little who had guided Leicester City to the Wembley Play-Off final for a place in the Premier League four months earlier, and was to repeat the feat for the following two seasons. These were, bizarrely, B.L.U.E (Brian Little’s Ultimate Exponent) and Brilliantte (an anagram of Brian Little).  [PAR] Filbert spent his first season resplendent in the Club’s new all-blue strip with the new Fox-head logo on a white cinquefoil . This had replaced the Running Fox crest, was introduced in Filbert’s first season and was the basis of the present day crest. [PAR] Over the next twenty years Filbert has been a constant presence on matchdays, cheering on the team from the sidelines and entertaining the crowd with his antics. He has never missed a home match. He has outlasted fourteen managers and hundreds of players.  He has also made numerous visits to schools and to a whole variety of organisations around the City and County.  [PAR] He has met a host of celebrities including Kasabian, John Barnes, Gary Lineker, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Ricky Hatton, two-time Olympic gold medallist rower Andrew Triggs-Hodge, Jose Mourinho, Roberto Mancini, Englebert Humperdinck, David Neilson (aka Coronation Street’s  Roy Cropper) Rendall Munroe and Mark Selby.

"[DOC] [TLE] Scotland national football teamThe Scotland national football team represents Scotland in international football and is controlled by the Scottish Football Association. Scotland maintains its own national side that competes in the two major professional tournaments, the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. Scotland is not a member of the International Olympic Committee and therefore the national team does not compete in the Olympic Games. The majority of Scotland's home matches are played at the national stadium, Hampden Park. [PAR] Scotland are the joint oldest national football team in the world, alongside England, whom they played in the world's first international football match in 1872. Scotland has a longstanding rivalry with England,  whom they played annually from 1872 until 1989. The teams have met only five times since then, most recently in November 2014. [PAR] Scotland have qualified for the FIFA World Cup on eight occasions and the UEFA European Championship twice, but have never progressed beyond the first group stage of a finals tournament. The team have achieved some noteworthy results, such as beating the 1966 FIFA World Cup winners England 3–2 at Wembley Stadium in 1967. Archie Gemmill scored what has been described as one of the greatest World Cup goals ever in a 3–2 win during the 1978 World Cup against the Netherlands, who reached the final of the tournament. In their qualifying group for UEFA Euro 2008, Scotland defeated 2006 World Cup runners-up France 1–0 in both fixtures. [PAR] Scotland supporters are collectively known as the Tartan Army. The Scottish Football Association operates a roll of honour for every player who has made more than 50 appearances for Scotland. Kenny Dalglish holds the record for Scotland appearances, having played 102 times between 1971 and 1986. Dalglish scored 30 goals for Scotland and shares the record for most goals scored with Denis Law. [PAR] History [PAR] Early history  [PAR] Scotland and England are the oldest national football teams in the world.  Teams representing the two sides first competed at the Oval in five matches between 1870 and 1872. The two countries contested the first official international football match, at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, Scotland on 30 November 1872. The match ended in a goalless draw. All eleven players who represented Scotland that day played for Glasgow amateur club Queen's Park. Over the next forty years, Scotland played matches exclusively against the other three Home Nations—England, Wales and Ireland. The British Home Championship began in 1883, making these games competitive. The encounters against England were particularly fierce and a rivalry quickly developed. [PAR] Scotland lost just two of their first 43 international matches. It was not until a 2–0 home defeat by Ireland in 1903 that Scotland lost a match to a team other than England. This run of success meant that Scotland would have regularly topped the Elo ratings, which were calculated in 1997, between 1876 and 1904. Scotland won the British Home Championship outright on 24 occasions, and shared the title 17 times with at least one other team.The competition did not use goal difference or goal average to separate teams level on points, so the title was shared instead.  A noteworthy victory for Scotland before the Second World War was the 5–1 victory over England in 1928, which led to that Scotland side being known as the ""Wembley Wizards"". Scotland played their first match outside the British Isles in 1929, beating Norway 7–3 in Bergen.  Scotland continued to contest regular friendly matches against European opposition and enjoyed wins against Germany and France before losing to the Austrian ""Wunderteam"" and Italy in 1931.

[PAR] The Spirit of the Emerald Isles [PAR] Scotch whisky is no longer king. Where not long ago 20 cases of it sold for every single case of Irish, in the first six months of 2012, Irish whiskey outsold single malt Scotch on the US market for the first time since the 1930s. Jameson has recently ranked amongst the top 30 of the world’s biggest selling drink brands, as well as been the world’s fastest growing drink brand, with a sales increase of 750 percent since the late 1980’s. [PAR] Despite the success, the whiskey scene in Ireland is still nothing like what it used to be.  In 1887, the country boasted twenty eight whiskey distilleries, of which half a dozen were in Dublin, a couple in Belfast, and the rest scattered around the country, from Antrim to Cork. Just over a century later, with the exception of the illicit 'poteen', still made today but now in the family kitchen using town gas rather than in a secluded cove over a wood fire, the production of Irish whiskey is almost exclusively concentrated in the hands of one multi-national company.  [PAR] A History of Distilling in Ireland [PAR] The Irish claim (with some justification), that they actually invented whiskey and say it was a particular gift to them from St Patrick or missionary monks during the seventh century. The Irish then kindly exported their knowledge to the rest of the world. Certainly, the Scots most likely learned about distilling from the Irish (though they are loath to admit it). Although historical details remain obscure, it does seem reasonable to believe that Irish monks were distilling aqua vitae [""water of life""] ,primarily for making medical compounds, but these first distillates were probably grape or fruit brandy rather than grain spirit.  Barley-based 'whiskey' (the word whiskey itself derives from 'uisce beatha', the Gaelic interpretation of 'aqua vitae') first appears in the historical records in the mid-1500's when the Tudor kings began to consolidate English control in Ireland. From this it may be conjectured that the Irish were the first to use cereals as a base for making spirit.  [PAR] Indeed, by the middle 1500's, so much whiskey was being consumed by the Irish that the government passed a law against drunkenness, and the makers of whiskey were deemed undesirable.(Even Queen Elizabeth I was said to be fond of it and had casks shipped to London on a regular basis).  As in Scotland and other whiskey producing countries, it was realised that the only way to curb whiskey production and consumption was to tax it: In 1661 the then Government introduced a tax of 4 pence on each and every gallon distilled. This imposition had the same effect as it did in Scotland, with the immediate commencement of the production of'poteen'(the Irish version of moonshine). The tax failed to slow down the growth of the industry and so by 1785 it was increased to one shilling and tuppence. The last straw for some distillers was in 1815 when the tax was levied at a crippling six shillings. It was this which drove many to produce there goods illicitly and by the end of the 18th century it is thought that there were over 2,000 stills in operation around the country.  Some decided to distill legally and attempted to raise the capital to set up larger distilleries. Of these, by far the most successful were the four big Dublin distillers:  John Power, John Jameson, George Roe and William Jameson.  [PAR] Under British rule, Ireland had become export oriented and along with grains and assorted foodstuffs, Irish distillers continued to produce large quantities of pot-distilled whiskey for export into the expanding British Empire. Irish whiskey out-sold Scotch whisky in most markets because it was lighter in",What is the name of the Irish whiskey illicitly made from barley?,"['potcheen', 'poteen', 'poitin']",036e7940560d4be789323220213d6300,"[{'end': [1267], 'start': [1262]}]","∃x (IllicitlyMade(x, Barley) ∧ IrishWhiskey(x))"
"[DOC] [TLE] Ipswich Town F.C.Ipswich Town Football Club (; also known as Ipswich, The Blues, Town, or The Tractor Boys) is a professional association football club based in Ipswich, Suffolk, England. They play in the Championship, the second highest division in English football, having last appeared in the Premier League in the 2001–02 season. [PAR] The club was founded in 1878 but did not turn professional until 1936, and was subsequently elected to join the Football League in 1938. They play their home games at Portman Road in Ipswich. The only fully professional football club in Suffolk, they have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with Norwich City in Norfolk, with whom they have contested the East Anglian derby 139 times since 1902. The club's traditional home colours are blue shirts and white shorts. [PAR] Ipswich have won the English league title once, in their first season in the top flight in 1961–62, and have twice finished runners-up, in 1980–81 and 1981–82. They won the FA Cup in 1977–78, and the UEFA Cup in 1980–81. They have competed in the top two tiers of English football uninterrupted since 1957–58, currently the longest streak among Championship clubs after Coventry were relegated in the 2011–12 season.  They have competed in all three European club competitions, and have never lost at home in European competition, defeating Real Madrid, AC Milan, Internazionale, Lazio and Barcelona, among others.  [PAR] History  [PAR] Early years and entry to the Football League  [PAR] The club was founded as an amateur side in 1878 and were known as Ipswich A.F.C. until 1888 when they merged with Ipswich Rugby Club to form Ipswich Town Football Club.  The team won a number of local cup competitions, including the Suffolk Challenge Cup and the Suffolk Senior Cup.  They joined the Southern Amateur League in 1907 and, with results improving steadily, became champions in the 1921–22 season. The club won the league a further three times, in 1929–30, 1932–33 and 1933–34, before becoming founder members of the Eastern Counties Football League at the end of the 1934–35 season. A year later, the club turned professional and joined the Southern League, which they won in its first season and finished third in the next. [PAR] Ipswich  were  elected to The Football League on 30 May 1938, and played in Division Three (South) until the end of the 1953–54 season, when they won the title and promotion to Division Two. [PAR] Promotion and instant First Division success  [PAR] The club were immediately relegated back to Division Three (South) the following year at the end of a poor season, but made better progress after Scott Duncan was replaced as team manager by Alf Ramsey in August 1955. The club won the Division Three (South) title again in 1956–57, and returned to the higher division. This time, Ipswich established themselves in Division Two, and as the division champions, won promotion to the top level of English football, Division One, in 1960–61. [PAR] In the top flight for the first time, Ipswich became Champions of the Football League at the first attempt in 1961–62. As English league champions, they qualified for the 1962–63 European Cup, defeating Maltese side Floriana 14–1 on aggregate before losing to Milan. Ramsey quit the club in April 1963 to take charge of the England national team; after the team won the 1966 World Cup, he received a knighthood for ""services to football"" in 1967.  [PAR] Decline and revival after Ramsey  [PAR] Ramsey was replaced by Jackie Milburn, under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch plummeted. Two years after winning the league title, Ipswich slipped down to the Second Division in 1964, conceding 121 league goals in 42 games – one of the worst-ever defensive records in English senior football.  Milburn quit after just one full season and was replaced by Bill McGarry in 1964. The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion along with his assistant Sammy Chung in the 1967–68 season, winning the division by a single point ahead of Queens Park Rangers.

"[DOC] [TLE] Background | Dickens & the Victorian CityBackground | Dickens & the Victorian City [PAR] Dickens & the Victorian City A Tale of two Cities [PAR] Background [PAR] Dickens’s birthplace in Mile End Terrace, Portsmouth. [PAR] When we think of Dickens and the Victorian City, we think of Dickens and London. While it is impossible to underestimate the importance of London in Dickens’s work, readers, critics, and enthusiasts inevitably ignore the indirect influence of those other English villages, towns and cities in which Dickens lived, worked, and played, including Portsmouth, the city in which he was born. The significance of Portsmouth in Dickens’s work is often overlooked and little is made of the impact of the city on his work or on related links between Portsmouth and Dickens’s family, and his theatrical, novelistic, and philanthropic interests: Dickens’s father, John Dickens (1785-1851) was a clerk in the pay office of the Royal Navy attached to the Portsmouth dockyard; Dickens’s son, Sydney Smith Haldimand Dickens (1847-72) enrolled in Eastman’s Naval Academy in Southsea in 1859, later joining the Royal Navy in 1860 which he made his career; and the Royal Navy features in a number of Dickens’s works, most notably in Dombey and Son (1846-48). [PAR] Dickens was baptised on 4th March in St Marys Church in 1812 by his parents, John and Elizabeth. [PAR] In addition, Dickens visited Portsmouth on a number of occasions, mentioned it in numerous works and, in 1859, wrote an essay on the city in All the Year Round. Furthermore, by some odd quirk of fate, Portsmouth’s more genteel neighbour, Southsea, became the final resting place of two of the women to whom Dickens was romantically attached in his lifetime: Maria Beadnell and the actress, Ellen Ternan . [PAR] Ellen Ternan, reputedly Dickens’s mistress, is buried in Highland Road Cemetery in Portsmouth. [PAR] Dickens’s stay in Portsmouth was brief: on the 7 February 1812 Charles John Huffam Dickens was born in Landport, Portsmouth to John Dickens and his wife Elizabeth (1789-1863).

On the 4 March 1812, he was baptised at St Mary’s Church, Portsea, and while the building itself was demolished in the 1850s, and replaced by a new church built in the 1880s, the font in which he was christened remains intact and can be found at St Stephen’s, Portsmouth. In June 1812, it is thought that the Dickens family moved to lodgings at 16 Hawke Street, Portsmouth, and in December 1813 to 39 Wish Street (now King’s Road) Southsea. Neither building remains: the lodgings in Hawke Street were destroyed during the Second World War and the house in King’s Road has been demolished.

[PAR] He has often told me that he remembered the small front garden to the house at Portsea, from which he was taken away when he was two years old, and where, watched by a nurse through a low kitchen-window almost level with the gravel-walk, he trotted about with something to eat, and his little elder sister with him. He was carried from the garden one day to see the soldiers exercise; I perfectly recollect that, on our being at Portsmouth together while he was writing Nickleby, he recognised the exact shape of the military parade seen by him as a very infant, on the same spot, a quarter of a century before.

The ancient Romans used a different calendar system , and their year began in March and ended in February!

[PAR] Let's take a look at how the ancient Romans chose the names of the 12 months of the year . [PAR] March: The ancient Romans insisted that all wars cease during the time of celebration between the old and new years . Since March was the first month of the new year in ancient Rome, some historians believe the Romans named March after Mars , the Roman god of war . [PAR] April: Three theories exist regarding the origin of April's name. Some say April got its name from the Latin word meaning “second"" since April was the second month on the ancient calendar . Others claim it comes from “aperire,"" a Latin word meaning “to open ,"" because it represents the opening of buds and flowers in spring . Still others think April was named after the goddess Aphrodite. [PAR] May: May was named after Maia, an earth goddess of growing plants. [PAR] June: Apparently, June has always been a popular month for weddings! The Romans named June after Juno, the queen of the gods and patroness of marriage and weddings. [PAR] July: July was named after Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. Previously, July was called “Quintilis,"" which is Latin for “fifth."" [PAR] August: August was named after Augustus Caesar in 8 B.C. Previously, August was called “Sextillia,"" which was Latin for “sixth."" [PAR] Though we think of September, October, November, and December as months 9, 10, 11 and 12, these months were 7, 8, 9, and 10 on the ancient Roman calendar . This is how they got their names. [PAR] September: September's name comes from septem, Latin for “seven."" [PAR] October: October's name comes from octo, Latin for “eight."" [PAR] November: November's name comes from novem, Latin for “nine."" [PAR] December: December's name come from decem, Latin for “ten."" [PAR] February: Around 690 B.C., Numa Pompilius turned a period of celebration at the end of the year into a month of its own, named after the festival Februa. This is how February got its name. [PAR] January: Later, Pompilius added another month to the beginning of the year and named it January after Janus, the God of beginnings and endings. [PAR] In 1582, Pope Gregory adjusted the calendar , so most western nations began celebrating the start of the year on January 1. This new calendar became known as the ""Gregorian calendar .""

Image courtesy of the National Library of Australia: an24493323 [PAR] Australians are not renowned for rushing into major decisions—change is usually a slow and considered process. The journey towards choosing our own national anthem was no exception. [PAR] The move to replace God Save the Queen with an anthem unique to Australia began as early as the 1820s. Over the decades, public opinion has been constantly canvassed and numerous competitions held to find a suitable song. [PAR] Peter Dodds McCormick's Advance Australia Fair was officially declared Australia's national anthem by the Governor-General on 19 April 1984, close to 160 years after the first alternative anthems were put forward. The song was first performed in Sydney in 1878 and, interestingly, was sung at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia by a choir of 10,000 people. [PAR] Some early nominations [PAR] John Dunmore Lang, who published an Australian Anthem and an Australian Hymn in 1826, was an early advocate of a distinctively Australian anthem. South Australian Carl Linger wrote Song of Australia in 1860, which was suggested to the (then) Prime Minister in 1929 as a possible national anthem. Linger's composition remained a favourite with Australians and was on the shortlist of 'possibles' 117 years later when Australians voted for an anthem at a national poll. [PAR] The lead-up to change [PAR] The issue of the anthem provoked more and more debate. The Australian Broadcasting Commission held two competitions in 1943 and 1945, and the 1951 Commonwealth Jubilee celebrations competition was won by Henry Krips with This Land of Mine. The 1956 Olympic Games, staged in Melbourne, sparked a fresh and passionate debate about the need for a truly Australian anthem.

Image courtesy of the National Library of Australia: an12265747 [PAR] In 1974 a public opinion poll, which sampled an estimated 60,000 people, offered three songs for choice: Advance Australia Fair; Banjo Paterson's Waltzing Matilda ; and Linger's Song of Australia. Advance Australia Fair polled 51.4 per cent, prompting the (then) Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, to announce that it would become our national anthem. [PAR] After some intense political debate, a national poll was conducted in 1977 with over seven million people issued with ballot papers. The results were: Advance Australia Fair 43.2 per cent, Waltzing Matilda 28.3 per cent, God Save the Queen 18.7 per cent and Song of Australia 9.6 per cent. [PAR] A new anthem [PAR] In April 1984 the Governor-General issued a proclamation declaring that God Save the Queen was designated the Royal Anthem, to be played at public engagements in Australia attended by the Queen or members of the Royal family. At the same time, Advance Australia Fair was finally declared to be the official national anthem. [PAR] The original words of the song have been changed with 'Australia's sons let us rejoice' – the original first line – being replaced with 'Australians all let us rejoice' and further changes have occurred in the rarely sung third verse.

"[DOC] [TLE] Clint EastwoodClinton ""Clint"" Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, film director, producer, musician, and political figure. He rose to international fame with his role as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy of spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.   [PAR] For his work in the Western film Unforgiven (1992) and the sports drama Million Dollar Baby (2004), Eastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture, as well as receiving nominations for Best Actor. Eastwood's greatest commercial successes have been the adventure comedy Every Which Way But Loose (1978) and its sequel, the action comedy Any Which Way You Can (1980), after adjustment for inflation.  Other popular films include the Western Hang 'Em High (1968), the psychological thriller Play Misty for Me (1971), the crime film Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), the Western The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), the prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979), the action film Firefox (1982), the suspense thriller Tightrope (1984), the Western Pale Rider (1985), the war film Heartbreak Ridge (1986), the action thriller In the Line of Fire (1993), the romantic drama The Bridges of Madison County (1995), and the drama Gran Torino (2008). [PAR] In addition to directing many of his own star vehicles, Eastwood has also directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery drama Mystic River (2003) and the war film Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, and the drama Changeling (2008). The war drama biopic American Sniper (2014) set box office records for the largest January release ever and was also the largest opening ever for an Eastwood film. [PAR] Eastwood received considerable critical praise in France for several films, including some that were not well received in the United States. Eastwood has been awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he became a recipient of the Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and in 2007 he was awarded the Legion of Honour medal. In 2000, Eastwood was awarded the Italian Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for lifetime achievement. [PAR] Since 1967, Eastwood has run his own production company, Malpaso, which has produced all except four of his American films.  From 1986–88, Eastwood served as Mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, a non-partisan office. [PAR] Early life [PAR] Eastwood was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Clinton Eastwood Sr. (19061970) and his wife, Margaret Ruth (née Runner) Eastwood (19092006). He was nicknamed ""Samson"" by the hospital nurses because he weighed 11 lb at birth.   He has a younger sister, Jeanne (born 1934).  Eastwood's widowed mother later married a retired lumber executive, John Belden Wood (19132004), who became stepfather to Clint and Jeanne.  [PAR] Eastwood is of English, Irish, Scottish, and Dutch ancestry  and was raised in a working class environment. Eastwood is descended from Mayflower passenger William Bradford and through this line is the 12th generation of his family born in North America and the 13th generation to live in North America.    [PAR] His family moved often as his father worked at jobs along the West Coast.   They finally settled in Piedmont, California, where Eastwood attended Piedmont Junior High School.  Shortly before he was to enter Piedmont High School, he rode his bike on the school's sports field and tore up the wet turf; this resulted in his being asked not to enroll.  Instead, he attended Oakland Technical High School, where the drama teachers encouraged him to take part in school plays. However, Eastwood was not interested.

"[DOC] [TLE] The Herbs - Childrens TV | Jedi's ParadiseThe Herbs - Childrens TV | Jedi's Paradise [PAR] The Herbs The Herbs is a 60’s Children’s TV animated show. It was designed for pre-school children, but I think it appeals to all ages and was one of the new colour 'Watch with Mother' titles. The Herbs was created by Michael Bond and animated by Ivor Wood at Filmfair (who were responsible for Paddington and The Wombles). The first episode was transmitted on 12th February 1968. Only 13 episodes were made of this delightful programme, but that isn't the end of this story.  Parsley the Lion had become quite popular with the children that watched, so it was decided to give him his own show - Parsley the Lion and Friends. It was supposed to centre on Parsley more, but I think the original Herbs did that anyway.  The new programme also included all the characters that we met in The Herbs. Story Each episode began with the narrator (Gordon Rollings) talking about herbs in the garden, and each time he mentioned a different one, then the herb (plant) would appear. This was a magic herb garden, that you could only get access to by saying the magic word - Herbidacious.  The door of the garden would swing open and in we would all be let in. The garden was owned by Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary, where each week a new adventure would take place. It seems that all the animals in the Herb garden (Parsley, Dill, Sage) could see us watching, but none of the people (Sir Basil, Lady Rosemary etc.) could, which would really confuse Bayleaf as he wanted to know what Parsley was waving at. Each of the characters were named after a herb and they all had a song to sing us, see below for more details. The Herbs Characters Parsley the Lion ""I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley"" Parsley is a lovable Green Lion, whose mane and tail are made out of the herb parsley (hence the name). He is the one that shows us around the garden and loves waving to the viewers.  He's not a brave lion and hides whenever there is trouble/danger around or when strangers appear. He was once called Doctor Parsley when he combined herbs with the jumpers Aunt Mint knitted for the chives, and it cured their colds. Parsley also doesn't like to get his tail wet or climb, as he found out when climbing the Tarragon Plant. He pretended to climb it the first time, but only snuck across to the neighbouring tree and back down it again. Shame he got caught and had to climb it for real. But he did have fun playing in the clouds. He made Sir Basil suffer when he shot his tail off, as he pretended to be dead. Poor Sir Basil didn't know what to do, so as usual shouted for Lady Rosemary, who saw Parsley was faking it. His best friend is Dill the dog and both of them seem to get themselves into trouble. But once in a while Parsley does come up with a good idea, such as the time he persuaded Pashana Bedhi to use his snake charming skills to float Sage and his nest back in the tree. ""I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley with a tail for doing jobs of every kind but I mustn't treat it roughly or too harshly for it's such a useful thing to have behind"" His songs are: ""I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I am always very glad to see you wave but please don't shout or speak to me too harshly because I'm not particularly brave"" ""I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I really don't like climbing things at all so please don't shout or speak to me too harshly I am sure you wouldn't want to see me fall"" ""I'm a very friendly Lion called Parsley I'm supposed to pull this rope and ring the bell though I try to pull it gently never harshly I'm afraid that I'm not doing very well"" ""For today I","If Dill was a dog, what type of animal was Parsley?",['lion'],8df98df6eb014aedaed37213d51c7d04,"[{'end': [1767, 1989, 595, 2992, 3522, 1741, 1815, 3345, 3180, 714], 'start': [1764, 1986, 592, 2989, 3519, 1738, 1812, 3342, 3177, 711]}]","∃x (IsAnimal(x, Parsley) ∧ TypeOfAnimal(x, A))"

[PAR] Challenger was on mission STS-51-L, the 25th flight of the American Space Shuttle program. [PAR] This flight marked the first time a non-government civilian, schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, had flown aboard the Space Shuttle. McAuliffe was one of seven crewmates -- Gregory Jarvis, McAuliffe, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Francis ""Dick"" Scobee, and Michael J. Smith -- all of whom died in the accident. Jarvis was originally scheduled to fly on the previous shuttle flight but had been re-assigned to this flight and replaced by Congressman Bill Nelson. [PAR] In this photo from January 9, 1986, the Challenger crew takes a break during countdown training at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. Left to right are McAuliffe, Jarvis, Resnik, Scobee, McNair, Smith, and Onizuka. Source: NASA [PAR] This was the 10th mission for Challenger. It was planned to deploy the second in a series of Tracking and Data Relay Satellites, carry out the first flight of the Shuttle-Pointed Tool for Astronomy (SPARTAN-203)/Halley's Comet Experiment Deployable in order to observe Halley's Comet, and carry out several lessons from space as part of the Teacher in Space Project and the Shuttle Student Involvement Program. [PAR] The flight marked the first American orbital mission to involve in-flight fatalities. It was also the first American human spaceflight mission to launch and fail to reach space. [PAR] Because the mission was part of the Teacher in Space Project and the Shuttle Student Involvement Program, school-age children across the United States were watching the launch live from their classrooms. President Ronald Reagan made special note of this in his address to the nation regarding the Challenger accident that day. [PAR] On June 6, 1986, the Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident (more commonly known as The Rogers Commission Report ) stated the cause of the accident to have been the failure of the primary and secondary O-ring seals on the Challenger's right solid rocket booster (SRB). [PAR] NASA mission archives also note that cold weather was determined to be a contributing factor to the accident. The launch had been approved despite a predicted ambient temperature of 26 °F, well below the qualification limit of major components such as the SRBs, which had been certified for use only at temperatures above 40 °F. [PAR] Space Shuttle Challenger's smoke plume after its in-flight breakup, resulting in its crash and the deaths of all seven crew members. Source: NASA [PAR] Evidence found in the remnants of the crew cabin showed that several of the emergency air supplies carried by the astronauts had been manually activated, suggesting that forces experienced inside the cabin during breakup of the orbiter were not immediately fatal, and that at least three crew members were alive and capable of conscious action for some period of time following vehicle breakup. However, based on remnants found after the accident and transcripts of the moments leading up to the accident, it is believed that the crew died quickly and without full understanding of what was occurring. [PAR] Prior to this accident, Challenger was a star in NASA’s Space Shuttle program, flying more missions per year than Space Shuttle Columbia. In 1983 and 1984, Challenger flew on 85% of all Space Shuttle missions. Even when the Discovery and Atlantis joined the fleet, Challenger remained in heavy use with three missions a year from 1983 to 1985. [PAR] Challenger's many spaceflight accomplishments included the first American woman, African-American, and Canadian in space; three Spacelab missions; and the first night launch and night landing of a Space Shuttle.

"[DOC] [TLE] Warts and all - meaning and origin. - Phrase Finder'Warts and all' - the meaning and origin of this phrase [PAR] Warts and all [PAR] The whole thing; not concealing the less attractive parts. [PAR] Origin [PAR] This phrase is said to derive from Oliver Cromwell's instructions to the painter Sir Peter Lely, when commissioning a portrait. [PAR] At the time of the alleged instruction, Cromwell was Lord Protector of England. Lely had been portrait artist to Charles I and, following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, he was appointed as Charles II's Principal Painter in Ordinary. [PAR] Lely's painting style was, as was usual at the time, intended to flatter the sitter. Royalty in particular expected portraits to show them in the best possible light, if not to be outright fanciful. Lely's painting of Charles II shows what was expected of a painting of a head of state in the 17th century. It emphasizes the shapely royal calves - a prized fashion feature at that time. [PAR] Cromwell did have a preference for being portrayed as a gentleman of military bearing, but was well-known as being opposed to all forms of personal vanity. This 'puritan Roundhead' versus 'dashing Cavalier' shorthand is often used to denote the differences in style of the two opposing camps in the English Commonwealth and subsequent Restoration. It is entirely plausible that he would have issued a 'warts and all' instruction when being painted and it is unlikely that Lely would have modified his style and produced the 'warts and all' portrait of Cromwell unless someone told him to. [PAR] We have Cromwell's death mask as a reference. From that it is clear that Lely's portrait is an accurate record of Cromwell's actual appearance. [PAR] Despite the plausibility of the account, there doesn't appear to be any convincing evidence that Cromwell ever used the phrase 'warts and all'. The first record of a version of that phrase being attributed to him comes from Horace Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting in England, with some account of the principal artists, 1764. Walpole's authority for the attribution came from a reported conversation between John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham, the first occupant of Buckingham House, now Buckingham Palace, and the house's architect, Captain  William Winde. Winde claimed that: [PAR] Oliver  certainly sat to him, and while sitting, said to him - ""Mr Lely, I desire you would use all your skill to paint my picture truly like me, and not flatter me at all; but remark all these roughnesses, pimples, warts and everything as you see me, otherwise I will never pay a farthing for it."" [PAR] That was published in 1764 - over a hundred years after Lely painted Cromwell. Walpole included no evidence to support the attribution, nor any explanation of why no one else had mentioned the phrase in the preceding hundred years - this despite Cromwell's life being the subject of minutely detailed historical research and over 160 full-length biographies. We can only assume he was indulging in a piece of literary speculation rather than historical documentation. The first known citation in print of the actual phrase 'warts and all' is from a 'Chinese whisper' retelling of Walpole's story - an address given by an Alpheus Cary, in Massachusetts, in 1824: [PAR] When Cromwell sat for  his portrait he said, ""Paint me as I am, warts and all!"" [PAR] It may well be the case that Oliver Cromwell preferred portraits of him to be accurate, but it is most unlikely that he ever uttered the words 'warts and all'.[DOC] [TLE] warts and all | word historieswarts and all  |  word histories [PAR] Peter Lely – Portrait of Oliver Cromwell [PAR]   [PAR]   [PAR]   [PAR] In 1988, during the contest for the Republican presidential nomination, Vice-President George H.

While several of the previously mentioned languages (particularly the Eastern European ones) also write using the Roman alphabet due to the relatively quick transition between the alphabets, i.e. Romanian, Macedonian, Serbian, etc., they also write Cyrillic due of its ties to the Eastern Orthodox Church (Cyrillic being its dominant alphabet) and influence by the late Soviet Union, since about half of the world’s Cyrillic users are Russian. After Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, Cyrillic became the organization’s third official script, the other two being the Greek and Roman alphabets. [PAR] In blue countries Roman is the official script, in red it’s Cyrillic, in green it’s Greek, and in purple both Roman and Cyrillic are official [PAR] However, since the fall of the Soviet Union, some languages have been transitioning out of the Russian language and the Cyrillic alphabet and have either been moving on to the Roman alphabet, for the sake improving relations to the West and breaking ties to the Soviet Union, or to a more indigenous writing system, to revive parts of the regional culture suppressed by the Soviet Union. Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan had already made the Roman alphabet the official script, although they often still write Cyrillic alongside with it. Kazakhstan is currently debating whether or not to begin making the switch to the Roman alphabet, and it has made an official declaration to completely switch to the Roman alphabet by 2025. Though Serbia, Bosnia, and Kosovo have Cyrillic as an official script, the Roman alphabet is also official and is viable to write in. Georgia, a small country in the Caucasus Mountains, has transitioned away from the Russian language and the Cyrillic alphabet and returned to the Georgian language and alphabet, though the former is still an official script. Although Cyrillic is still an official script of Mongolia, the nation is attempting to transition away from Cyrillic (albeit slowly) and is attempting to revive (though with great difficulty) the traditional Mongolian script, a vertically-written cursive alphabet, and the post-communist generation has shown far less interest to speaking Russian than previous generations. Even in Bulgaria and Russia, though the populace generally prefers using the Cyrillic alphabet, are using the Latin alphabet in order to keep up with technological advances, particularly in phone typology.

"[DOC] [TLE] What is a Sidewinder Snake? (with pictures) - wiseGEEKWhat is a Sidewinder Snake? (with pictures) [PAR] What is a Sidewinder Snake? [PAR] Last Modified Date: 11 December 2016 [PAR] Copyright Protected: [PAR] 10 hilariously insightful foreign words [PAR] A sidewinder snake is one of two types of snakes found in arid regions of the southwestern part of the United States or Africa. These venomous snakes get their name from the way that they move. Unlike most snakes that slither head first, sidewinders travel sideways, leaving a J-shaped trail in the sand. [PAR] In America, Crotalus cerastes, or the horned rattlesnake, can be found in southwestern parts of the United States and northern parts of Mexico. There are three sub-species of this snake, which include the Mojave Desert sidewinder, the Sonoran Desert sidewinder, and the Colorado Desert sidewinder. Because they are all very similar in appearance, these three sub-species can be identified by the location where they are found. Mojave Desert sidewinders can be found throughout southern California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. Both the Colorado Desert sidewinder and Sonoran Desert sidewinder can be found in parts of southern California, Arizona, and northern Mexico. [PAR] The sidewinder snake in America is often colored to blend in with its surroundings. It can range from a pale to medium brown, and most of these snakes will have small dark patches on their backs. The nickname, horned rattlesnake, derives from the raised scales above their eyes. While they may appear to be horns, in reality, they are most likely there to protect the snake's eyes from sand and the hot sun. [PAR] The horned rattlesnake is thought to be a smaller species of rattlesnake . An adult sidewinder snake is on average between 17 to 32 inches (43 to 80 centimeters). Females of this species of snake are often larger than their male counterparts, which is slightly unusual. [PAR] During the hot summer months, the sidewinder snake is generally nocturnal, preferring to travel during the cooler nights. As the winter months approach, these snakes will often become diurnal, and travel during the day to avoid the extreme cold of the desert nights. In periods of extreme heat or cold, sidewinders are thought to hibernate, often burying themselves in the sand or occupying abandoned animal burrows. [PAR] The venom of the sidewinder snake is considered to be weaker than that of other species of rattlesnakes, and the animal also has smaller venom glands. While it is thought to be less dangerous, its bite still has the potential to be fatal. A sidewinder bite will typically be accompanied by pain, swelling, blistering, and bruising. Other symptoms include nausea, dizziness , chills, and possibly shock. [PAR] American sidewinders use heat-sensing pits located near their eyes to help them locate prey, and they use their venom to kill it before consumption. Depending on the age of the snake, its diet usually consists of lizards, rodents , or small birds. Younger snakes seem to prefer to snack on lizards, and some have been observed attracting them with their tails. As a sidewinder snake gets older, it stops this behavior, and small desert rodents, such as the kangaroo rat , become their main prey. [PAR] Mating season of this sidewinder snake is usually during late spring to early summer. Mothers will typically give birth in the early fall to as many as 18 live offspring, which are roughly 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 centimeters) long. It is generally agreed that the mother will stay with her babies inside the burrow for about a week to two weeks. After the baby snakes shed for the first time, they will then go out into the world. [PAR] In the Namib Desert of Africa, there is another type of sidewinder snake, Bitis peringueyi. Commonly known as the Peringuey's desert adder, this venomous snake also moves in a sideways motion like the horned rattlesnake. It is usually light brown to gray in color, and it also blends into its surroundings with the same dark markings down its back. This smaller relative, however, typically reaches an average length of 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 centimeters)",What type of snake is a sidewinder?,['rattlesnake'],48428dac758b49a08f847cf50d88d52b,"[{'end': [1477, 632, 1735, 3933, 1685], 'start': [1467, 622, 1725, 3923, 1675]}]","∃x (TypeOfSnake(x) ∧ NameOfSnake(x, ""sidewinder""))"
"[DOC] [TLE] Robert Downey Jr. - movietimes.comRobert Downey Jr. biography. [PAR] Filmography [PAR] Robert Downey Jr. BIOGRAPHY [PAR] Robert John Downey, Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor. Downey made his screen debut in 1970, at the age of five, when he appeared in his father's film Pound, and has worked consistently in film and television ever since. During the 1980s he had roles in a series of coming of age films associated with the Brat Pack. Less Than Zero (1987) is particularly notable, not only because it was the first time Downey's acting would be acknowledged by critics, but also because the role pushed Downey's already existing drug habit one step further. After Zero, Downey started landing roles in bigger films such as Air America (1990), Soapdish (1991) and Natural Born Killers (1994). He played Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 film Chaplin, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. [PAR] Between 1996 and 2001, Downey was frequently arrested on drug-related charges and went through several drug treatment programs, but had difficulty staying clean. After being released from the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in 2000, Downey joined the cast of the hit television series Ally McBeal, playing the new love interest of Calista Flockhart's title character. His performance was praised and received accolades, but his character was written out when Downey was fired after two drug arrests in late 2000 and early 2001. After one last stay in a court-ordered drug treatment program, Downey finally achieved lasting sobriety and his career began to take off again. He appeared in semi-independent films such as The Singing Detective (2003), Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), and A Scanner Darkly (2006). He also had supporting roles in the mainstream films Gothika (2003) and Zodiac (2007). In 2004, Downey released his debut studio album The Futurist. [PAR] In 2007, Downey was cast as the title character in the comic book adaptation Iron Man. The film was a huge success; the opening weekend for Iron Man is still in the top 20 openings of all time. He reprised the role of Tony Stark in the 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2, and will again in 2012 in The Avengers and in the third movie of the planned trilogy, Iron Man 3, due to open in 2013. In addition to receiving commercial success, Downey's performance in the first Iron Man film received rave reviews. Downey was nominated for—and won—a number of end-of-year awards from critics and film associations around the world. Downey's other 2008 films included Charlie Bartlett and the Ben Stiller-directed Tropic Thunder, in which he portrayed an Australian method actor overly engrossed in his role as an African-American soldier. He received his second Oscar nomination for the film, in the category of Best Supporting Actor. In 2009, Downey starred as the titular lead character in Guy Ritchie's adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, released Christmas 2009.

Named for Revolutionary War general and South Carolina native Thomas Sumter, Fort Sumter was one of nearly 50 forts built as part of the so-called Third System, a coastal defense program implemented by Congress in 1817. The three-tiered, five-sided fort’s coastal placement was designed to allow it to control access to the vital Charleston Harbor. While the island itself was only 2.4 acres in size, the fort was built to accommodate a garrison of 650 soldiers and 135 artillery pieces. [PAR] Did You Know? [PAR] There were no casualties during the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter at the start of the American Civil War. The only Union deaths came during the evacuation: One soldier was killed and another mortally wounded in an accidental explosion during a planned 100-gun salute. [PAR] Construction of Fort Sumter first began in 1829 in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, on a manmade island built from thousands of tons of granite. Building ground to a halt in the 1830s amid a dispute over ownership of the stretch of the harbor, and did not resume until 1841. Like many Third System fortifications, Fort Sumter proved a costly endeavor, and construction slowed again in 1859 due to lack of funding. By 1860 the island and the outer fortifications were complete, but the fort’s interior and armaments remained unfinished. [PAR] Fort Sumter: The First Battle of Fort Sumter [PAR] Construction of Fort Sumter was still underway when South Carolina seceded from the Union on December 20, 1860. Despite Charleston’s position as a major port, at the time only two companies of federal troops guarded the harbor. Commanded by Major Robert Anderson (1805-1871), these companies were stationed at Fort Moultrie, a dilapidated fortification facing the coastline. Recognizing that Fort Moultrie was vulnerable to a land assault, Anderson elected to abandon it for the more easily defensible Fort Sumter on December 26, 1860. South Carolina militia forces would seize the city’s other forts shortly thereafter, leaving Fort Sumter as the lone federal outpost in Charleston. [PAR] A standoff ensued until January 9, 1861, when a ship called the Star of the West arrived in Charleston with over 200 U.S. troops and supplies intended for Fort Sumter. South Carolina militia batteries fired upon the vessel as it neared Charleston Harbor, forcing it to turn back to sea. Major Anderson refused repeated calls to abandon Fort Sumter, and by March 1861 there were over 3,000 militia troops besieging his garrison. A number of other U.S. military facilities in the Deep South had already been seized, and Fort Sumter was viewed by many as one of the South’s few remaining hurdles to overcome before achieving sovereignty. [PAR] With the inauguration of President Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) in March 1861, the situation soon escalated. Knowing that Anderson and his men were running out of supplies, Lincoln announced his intention to send three unarmed ships to relieve Fort Sumter. Having already declared that any attempt to resupply the fort would be seen as an act of aggression, South Carolina militia forces soon scrambled to respond. On April 11, militia commander P.G.T. Beauregard (1818-1893) demanded that Anderson surrender the fort, but Anderson again refused. In response Beauregard opened fire on Fort Sumter shortly after 4:30 a.m. on April 12, 1861. U.S. Captain Abner Doubleday (1819-1893)—later famous for the myth that he invented baseball—ordered the first shots in defense of the fort a few hours later. [PAR] Beauregard’s 19 coastal batteries unleashed a punishing barrage on Fort Sumter, eventually firing an estimated 3,000 shots at the citadel in 34 hours. By Saturday, April 13, cannon fire had broken through the fortress’s five-foot-thick brick walls, causing fires inside the post. With his stores of ammunition depleted, Anderson was forced to surrender the fort shortly after 2 p.m. in the afternoon.

Epiphany refers not only to the day itself but to the church season that follows it – a season that has a varied length because it ends when Lent begins, and this depends on the date of Easter. [PAR] It commemorates the first two occasions on which Jesus’ divinity, according to Christian belief, was manifested: when the three kings (also known as wise men or Magi) visited infant Jesus in Bethlehem, and when John the Baptist baptized him in the River Jordan. The Roman Catholic and Protestant churches emphasize the visit of the Magi when they celebrate the Epiphany. The Eastern Orthodox churches focus on Jesus’ baptism. [PAR] Epiphany is one of the oldest Christian feasts. It was celebrated since the end of the second century, before the Christmas holiday was established. Like other Christian seasons, the church appropriated Epiphany from an old pagan festival. As early as 1996 BCE, the Egyptians celebrated the winter solstice (which then occurred on January 6) with a tribute to Aeon, the Virgin. It is important to note that the holiday was established prior to the Gregorian calendar’s introduction. [PAR] Symbols [PAR] Various paintings, artworks and sketches show the three wise men and Jesus.

He was the son of Zeus and Hera and married to Aphrodite by Zeus to prevent a war of the gods fighting for her hand. He was a smithing god, making all of the weapons for Olympus and acting as a blacksmith for the gods. [PAR] He had his own palace on Olympus where he made many clever inventions and automatons of metal to work for him. Hephaestus’s ugly appearance was the reason Zeus chose him to marry Aphrodite, but despite this she had many affairs with both gods and men. [PAR] In one story, Hephaestus builds a tricky invention which catches Aphrodite laying with the Ares , the god of war, trapping them both in the bed to be laughed at and ridiculed by the other gods. [PAR] He is similar to Athena in his giving skill and help to mortals – in his case artists. It was believed that Hephaestus taught men the arts alongside Athena. However, he was also considered far inferior to that of the goddess of wisdom. [PAR] Facts about Hephaestus [PAR] Hephaestus was known as the God of Fire. [PAR] In some accounts, he was said to be the son of Zeus and Hera; in others, he was the son of Hera alone, conceived in order to get back at Zeus for bringing forth Athena. [PAR] Hephaestus was the only ugly god among perfectly beautiful immortals. [PAR] Hephaestus was born deformed and was cast out of heaven by one or both of his parents when they noticed that he was imperfect. [PAR] He was the workman of the immortals: he made their dwellings, furnishings, and weapons. [PAR] In his workshop, Hephaestus had assistants who were made out of gold and who helped him with his work. [PAR] His forge or workshop was located under a volcano, and the work he did within it caused frequent eruptions. [PAR] In most accounts, Aphrodite is named as his wife, although she was unfaithful to him (with Ares, for one). Theirs was an arranged marriage. [PAR] Hephaestus was a patron of the arts. [PAR] He was a kind and peace-loving god. [PAR] In art, Hephaestus is usually depicted as bending over an anvil or walking with the assistance of a cane. [PAR] He was worshipped primarily in Athens, where he had a temple. [PAR] Hephaestus manufactured the aegis (or shield) that Athena is known for carrying. [PAR] The arrows of Eros (known also as Cupid) were fashioned by Hephaestus as well. [PAR] Hephaestus was the god of the ceremony when children were officially admitted to the city organization. [PAR] According to a story told both by Homer and Hesiod, Hephaestus married Aglaia, one of the three Graces. [PAR] Hephaestus was known for making a gold basket that Europa, daughter of the King of Sidon, used to gather flowers when she happened upon Zeus in the meadow. [PAR] Hephaestus crafted the armor that Achilles wore in the Trojan War. The same arms, despite their connection to divinity, brought about the death of Ajax.

The result was 'The Shootist’, a rich    and elegiac western and, says Philip Horne, a fitting swansong for    Hollywood’s most courageous gunslinger. [PAR]   [PAR] Image 1 of 2 [PAR] His last stand: John Wayne in a scene from 'The Shootist' (1976), made when he was terminally ill with cancer.  [PAR]   [PAR] John Wayne in The Shootist Photo: PARAMOUNT/ALLSTAR [PAR] By Philip Horne [PAR] 5:51PM BST 20 Sep 2010 [PAR] During the making of The Shootist (1976), Don Siegel’s rich, elegiac western about an ageing gunfighter dying of “a cancer”, its star John Wayne became too ill to film. The actor had had a lung removed twelve years earlier and was now struggling with the stomach cancer that would eventually lead to his death in 1979. A few days later, when Wayne bravely returned to the set, he picked a quarrel with the director, who had carried on filming a gunfight scene in his absence, over the way his character was shown killing a villain. [PAR] He forced Siegel to redo the scene, declaring: “Whatever the cause, I would never shoot anyone in the back. It’s unthinkable for my image… I spent many years in this business building up my image.” [PAR] He certainly did – but he wasn’t the only one. The 6ft 4in Marion Morrison was a former USC American football player with a few bit parts to his rather girlie name, when he was spotted carrying an armchair across the Fox Studios lot by legendary director Raoul Walsh (one-eyed, but sharp-eyed). Walsh cast him in The Big Trail (1930) – a western, the genre Wayne would above all be associated with – and renamed him after Revolutionary War general “Mad Anthony Wayne”. [PAR] But it was director John Ford who turned Wayne into an all-time star, by casting him as the Ringo Kid, in Stagecoach (1939), which is perhaps the definitive western (though based on a Maupassant novel). [PAR] Wayne’s character makes his first appearance standing on the trail, firing into the air to stop the stagecoach and, as the camera whips in to a breathless close-up, he announces that: “You might need me and this Winchester, Curly!” In his dark placket-front shirt, light army-style braces, bandana and broad white hat, Ringo is a dazzling vision of male beauty and heroism. Wayne was already 32, with 78 films behind him – but the freshness of this “Kid” is unforgettable. [PAR] Related Articles [PAR] John Wayne's eye patch up for auction [PAR] 28 Sep 2011 [PAR] The Shootist opens with a montage of its hero’s past exploits – taken from Red River (Howard Hawks, 1948), Hondo (John Farrow, 1953), Rio Bravo and El Dorado (Hawks, 1959 and 1966).

"[DOC] [TLE] 17 Facts You Might Not Know about Bonanza - Neatorama17 Facts You Might Not Know about Bonanza - Neatorama [PAR] Neatorama [PAR] • 21 [PAR] In 431 episodes spanning from 1959 to 1973, the Cartwrights of the Nevada Territory's Ponderosa became a fixture of American life. Let's take a look at some facts that you might not know about Bonanza . [PAR] 1. The historic Virginia City was the center of the famed 1859 silver strike known as the Comstock Lode. It promptly became the very image of the Old West boom town, with fortunes won and lost, exploited Chinese laborers, glamorous and impoverished prostitutes, and violent struggles with Native Americans. [PAR] Samuel Clemens worked as a reporter in Virginia City for two years and there selected his pen name of Mark Twain. In was this varied, colorful era and place that producer David Dortort decided would be ideal for the show. [PAR] 2. When Bonanza premiered in 1959, the airwaves were saturated with sitcoms that depicted fathers as idiots managed by their wives. Dortort insisted that the show be an hour long instead of a half hour in order to ensure that he had time to depict Ben Cartwright as a father figure worthy of respect. It worked, and Lorne Greene received thousands of fan letters from teenage boys who wished that he was their father. [PAR] 3. Dortort envisioned Bonanza as an Old West presentation of the legend of King Arthur. Ben Cartwright was King Arthur and his sons were his knights. [PAR] 4.Did you notice that the characters wear the same outfits almost every episode? This was done to make it easier to work in stock footage when necessary -- not that the show was cheap. At $100,000-150,000 per episode, it was among the most expensive shows on TV during its run. [PAR] 5. Lorne Greene ’s father, Daniel Greene, made orthopedic shoes and boots for a living. He named his son after his first customer, a man named Lorne MacKenzie. When Lorne Greene delivered the 1971 commencement address at his alma mater, Queen’s University in Ontario, he gave the graduates advice appropriate for his heritage. Greene said “get yourself a really comfortable bed or a really good pair of shoes, because you’re going to be in one or the other for the rest of your life.” [PAR] 6. Greene started out as a radio announcer. He was the chief broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and during the Battle of Britain, he was known as ""the voice of doom."" To time his speaking better, Greene invented a stopwatch that ran backwards. [PAR] ( Video Link ) [PAR] 7. Most of the show's actors created musical albums, and all four Cartwrights sang in a 1964 album called "" Christmas at the Ponderosa ."" Greene was especially successful in this field, and his single "" Ringo "" was a huge hit in the US and Canada. But I suspect that you'd prefer to hear Greene sing the theme song to Bonanza, which is embedded above. [PAR] 8. Pernell Roberts absolutely despised the show and tried to get out of his contract at the outset. It took him six years of steady resistance before NBC gave in. Roberts considered the scripts too low brow, demeaning to women, and indecently glorifying wealth in age of poverty. Roberts’ politics were strongly progressive by the standards of the time, and he pushed producers to have Adam Cartwright marry a Native American woman played by a black actress. [PAR] 9. Guy Williams, who played John Robinson on Lost in Space , was the first choice to play Adam Cartwright. But Williams took up Zorro instead.  Williams was, however, brought on for five episodes as cousin Will Cartwright. The producers invented this character to be a ready replacement for Pernell Roberts if he ever walked off the show. [PAR] 10. Dan Blocker (Hoss Cartwright) weighed 14 pounds at birth, then the largest baby ever born in Bowie County, Texas. By the time that he was in the first grade, Blocker weighed 105 pounds. While in college, he was recruited to play a role in a production of “Arsenic and Old Lace” that required tremendous physical strength.

"[DOC] [TLE] West Africa - University of Nebraska OmahaWest Africa [PAR] West Africa [PAR] Questions [PAR] Regional Characteristics [PAR] Located in sub-Saharan Africa, West Africa is defined by a series of elongated countries that border the Atlantic Ocean, with an exception of Burkina Faso. The countries are small in area compared to the other parts of Africa. Western Africa makes up the largest population cluster in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the population lives in the southern coastal area, along the Atlantic, a result of European trading that led to economic development beginning in the 1200s. [PAR] The area consists of plateaus with coastal plains. The coastal areas have a tropical climate while the northern areas transition to savannas. The countries to the north that extend across the southern Sahara tend to be very large, mostly steppe, and contain a lot of deserts. While the remaining West African countries tend to be smaller, elongated and have wetter environments. [PAR] West African agriculture is based on cash crops for exports in the coastal trade areas. There are many different sorts of exports that come out of Western Africa. The most common crops are peanuts, sorghum, cotton, rice, cassava, coffee, and livestock.  One of the most important crops for countries like Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana is cacao, which is grown in the fertile soil of the wet areas.  The countries of West Africa have incomes to a large extent derived from the sale of their products on the international market. [PAR] The Europeans developed the coastal areas for trade. The people living along the coasts became the middlemen in trade, especially in the slave trade. They experienced changes of the colonial period in education, religion, urbanization, agriculture, politics, and health. The people living in the interior experienced less change, which resulted in divisions among people. All of the countries, except Liberia, experienced colonial control.  The Portuguese settled in Guinea-Bissau. Togo was a German settlement.  The British colonies were Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Gambia. The French colonized the remainder of West Africa, except Liberia, which remained independent. No coastal or interior railroad transportation system was developed, so the countries are not interdependent economically.  Railroads were developed but they ran perpendicular to the coastal areas to transport goods and minerals to be exported. [PAR] The population distribution is coastal corresponding to the major economic regions. The southern half of the region is home to the majority of the people. Total population of the area is 210 million. Nigeria is the largest country with 123.3 million. The next most populous country is Ghana with 19.5 million people.  Smaller countries include Senegal, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Togo and Benin. [PAR] West African culture is expressed in architecture, arts, music and dance.  There are more than one thousand languages.  In Nigeria over 250 languages are used so all school instruction takes place in English.  Muslim and Christianity are the primary religions, although there are many different religions practiced.  Many people use the barter system to buy and sell goods at the markets in rural areas. [PAR] Countries [PAR] At 123.3 million, Nigeria is the largest country in Western Africa having 59 percent of the entire population of sub-Saharan Africa. The country has two distinct climates. A tropical climate dominates along the coast that brings heavy rainfall and high humidity. In the north there are dry, dusty winds that come from the Sahara. English is the official language of Nigeria, but the most commonly used language is Hausa, a lingua franca in West Africa. Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and established a federal political system that divided the country into three areas based on culture. The Yoruba, located in the southwest, are people with a long history of urbanization and agriculture. Their capital, Lagos, was the first capital and now has a population of 12 million people. The Ibo people, with a population of 20 million, live in the southwest around Port Harcourt. They are less urbanized, more densely populated, and were less affected by the changes colonialism brought.

My childhood friend, Lee, was a big fan of Janis, and introduced me to her tunes. I was immediately captivated by her soulful sounds and the bluesy beat of her songs. [PAR] While Janis Joplin recorded four studio albums, few compare with the tunes on Pearl. Released in 1971 just a few months after her death, it quickly became the number 1 album on the Billboard music charts, where it stayed for 9 full weeks. What was the reason for this popularity? [PAR] I believe it is because Janis sang from the heart. Her voice is a bit mournful, and her words come from deep within her soul. While some of the songs show a bit of humor - such as ""Mercedes Benz"", others touch on love and life. [PAR] Image Source: Amazon [PAR] There have been several re-releases of Pearl, and with each release, new songs are added. I prefer the original album (and speaking of original - I do own the vinyl, in addition to the CD), because it is the original form.

While I'm happy with the original Pearl album, it's a bonus to have these other songs in one complete set. [PAR] Me & Bobby McGee [PAR] One of my favorite Janis Joplin songs is ""Me & Bobby McGee"". It was originally written by Kris Kristofferson and performed by a number of other artists before and since Janis. However, Janis' version is not only recognized by more people, but more popular. When Janis released it as a single, it became her only number 1 single recording. [PAR] More Janis Joplin [PAR] Another great album featuring Janis Joplin is Cheap Thrills . Released in 1968, it was the 2nd album by Big Brother and the Holding Company, and the last album by that band that featured Janis as the lead singer. My favorite songs on this album are: Piece of My Heart, Summertime, and Ball & Chain. [PAR] In 1967, Janis Joplin made her first large-scale appearance at the Monterey Pop Concert , which was a 3-day outdoor event. Performing with Big Brother & The Holding Company, Janis performed ""Ball & Chain"", which ultimately caused them to be signed by a major record company.

"[DOC] [TLE] HawaiiHawaii  ( ; locally,; ) is the 50th and most recent state of the United States of America, receiving statehood on August 21, 1959.  Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas. The state does not observe daylight saving time. [PAR] The state encompasses nearly the entire volcanic Hawaiian archipelago, which comprises hundreds of islands spread over 1500 mi. At the southeastern end of the archipelago, the eight main islands are—in order from northwest to southeast: Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lānai, Kahoolawe, Maui and the Island of Hawaii. The last is the largest island in the group; it is often called the ""Big Island"" or ""Hawaii Island"" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. The archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania. [PAR] Hawaii's diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists. Because of its central location in the Pacific and 19th-century labor migration, Hawaii's culture is strongly influenced by North American and Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian culture. Hawaii has over a million permanent residents, along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel. Its capital is Honolulu on the island of Oahu. [PAR] Hawaii is the 8th-smallest and the 11th-least populous, but the 13th-most densely populated of the fifty U.S. states. It is the only state with an Asian plurality. The state's coastline is about 750 mi long, the fourth longest in the U.S. after the coastlines of Alaska, Florida and California. [PAR] Etymology [PAR] The state of Hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island, Hawaii. A common Hawaiian explanation of the name of Hawaii is that was named for Hawaiiloa, a legendary figure from Hawaiian myth. He is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled.   [PAR] The Hawaiian language word Hawaii is very similar to Proto-Polynesian *Sawaiki, with the reconstructed meaning ""homeland"".  Cognates of Hawaii are found in other Polynesian languages, including Māori (Hawaiki), Rarotongan (ʻAvaiki) and Samoan (Savaii) . According to linguists Pukui and Elbert,  ""[e]lsewhere in Polynesia, Hawaii or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home, but in Hawaii, the name has no meaning"".  [PAR] Spelling of state name [PAR] A somewhat divisive political issue arose in 1978 when the Constitution of the State of Hawaii added Hawaiian as a second official state language.  The title of the state constitution is The Constitution of the State of Hawaii. ArticleXV, Section1 of the Constitution uses The State of Hawaii.  Diacritics were not used because the document, drafted in 1949,  predates the use of the okina () and the kahakō in modern Hawaiian orthography. The exact spelling of the state's name in the Hawaiian language is Hawaii. In the Hawaii Admission Act that granted Hawaiian statehood, the federal government recognized Hawaii as the official state name. Official government publications, department and office titles, and the Seal of Hawaii use the traditional spelling with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length.  In contrast, the National and State Parks Services, the University of Hawaii and some private enterprises implement these symbols. No precedent for changes to U.S. state names exists since the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1789. However, the Constitution of Massachusetts formally changed the Province of Massachusetts Bay  to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1780, and in the 1819 the Territory of Arkansaw was created but was later admitted to statehood as State of Arkansas. [PAR] Geography and environment [PAR] There are eight main Hawaiian islands, seven of which are permanently inhabited.

A couple of years later, ‘Jaws’ the phenomenon was in full swing – and cinema would never be the same again. [PAR] Credited with being the first summer ‘event’ movie is, perhaps, a dubious honour, but ‘Jaws’, when considered as merely a piece of cinema, more than lives up to its legend. [PAR] A girl strips off her clothes and bounds gleefully to the sea in the opening sequence, and we are taken in with her. When the camera sinks below the surface, prompting the first bars of John Williams’ immortal score, we know what she doesn’t. But we are powerless to help. Don’t go in, we implore silently.  Towards the end of her futile struggle, she chokes, “Oh, it hurts”, through a mouthful of foam and blood, and is taken down for the last time. At this point, we exhale, and realise we haven’t done so for some while. [PAR] From this, arguably one of the most memorable openings in cinema history, the tension rarely relents. One by one, we are introduced to the main players: Chief Brody (Roy Scheider), Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (a career best Robert Shaw).  Brody’s fish out of water (if you’ll excuse the pun) city cop is perfectly pitched to conflict with Hooper, the wealthy shark expert from the Oceanographic Institute, who, in turn, is constantly baited by the domineering presence of old-school fisherman, Quint. [PAR] One of director Steven Spielberg’s achievements is in perfectly balancing the verbal interplay, resulting in the scenes of character development which bring relief between each action set-piece and prove as memorable as the shark attacks themselves. The script (credited to Carl Gottlieb, but in fact, somewhat of a joint venture) takes some of the plaudits, but ultimately it must be the director who receives acknowledgement for ensuring that, by the time the final hunt is on, these characters are as familiar to us as any cast member of a long running soap opera. [PAR] After a number of skilfully executed scenes of attack, public denial by the Mayor (Murray Hamilton) and his office, a handful of red herrings and – finally – chaos on the fourth of July, the three men set sail on Quint’s boat, the Orca, to hunt the shark. Spielberg’s masterstroke is to not allow the audience a sight of land again until the end credits, creating an environment of perfect claustrophobia in the most open location on earth. [PAR] Once the hunters have become the hunted, there’s nowhere for the Orca to hide and there’s no relief for the audience. The tension is cranked like woven steel fishing line. Man is pitted in a primeval struggle against an unthinking, relentless adversary; death itself, if you will. This machine-like predator will not be bargained with and will not see reason. If it catches you, you’re dead. The final reveal of the beast itself is delayed and perfectly timed, which offsets the film’s only true shortcoming: its modest and somewhat dated special effects.

As in the case of the brasses, the addition  of tin to copper results in the formation of a series of  solid solutions. The constitutional diagram of copper-tin  alloys is very complex, but that part of it which deals with  alloys of industrial importance is reproduced in Fig. 1. [PAR] Figure 1. Constitutional Diagram of the Copper-Tin Alloys [PAR] The addition of tin to copper results in the formation of a  series of solid solutions which, in accordance with usual  practice, are referred to in order of diminishing copper  content as the á, â, a, etc., constituents.  The diagram may be summarized as follows: [PAR] Percentage composition [PAR] Constituent just below the freezing point [PAR] Constituent after slow cooling to 400°C [PAR] Copper [PAR] â–>(á + â) [PAR] á + ä [PAR] Further changes on cooling from 400°C to room temperature  are so sluggish that they only occur in conditions very far  removed from actual practice. [PAR] The á solution is the softest of the  constituents; it may be rolled or stamped cold, but it  hardens under this treatment much more rapidly decreases  than á-brass. [PAR] The â and a constituents do not exist in the alloy  slowly cooled to room temperature: this is due to successive  changes occurring at 586°C and 520°C whereby â is  resolved into á +a and a into á +  ä. [PAR] The ä constituent has the crystal structure of a-brass. It has a narrow range of composition  corresponding approximately to the formula Cu3lSn8 and, like all intermetallic compounds, is extremely hard and  brittle. The ä -> (á + l) change at  350°C does not occur in commercial practice, though alloys  richer in tin may contain the a constituent, which  corresponds to Cu3Sn, and the ç solid solution,  which approximates to the composition CuSn. [PAR] 95:5 Copper-Tin Alloy [PAR] On cooling from the liquid condition, the solid solution  which first forms contains only about 2 percent of tin. Thus  the cast metal has a cored structure and the coring is very  marked because of the long range between liquidus and solidus;  but it may be eliminated by diffusion on cooling more slowly  or by annealing. [PAR] Any absorption of oxygen occurring during manufacture results  in the presence of SnO2 in the alloy, tending to  make it brittle. A deoxidizer such as zinc is therefore  frequently added. The addition of zinc, as in coinage bronze,  causes no change in the microscopical appearance of the  homogeneous á constituent. The zinc, however, exerts  its deoxidizing effect in the liquid, and slight hardening  effect on the solid solution. The structure of a bronze coin  shows marked deformation of the crystals. On annealing,  recrystallization takes place with subsequent crystal growth.  Twinning is a characteristic feature of the cold-worked and  annealed alloy.

[PAR] First lady Jacqueline Kennedy rarely accompanied her husband on political outings, but she was beside him, along with Texas Governor John Connally and his wife, for a 10-mile motorcade through the streets of downtown Dallas on November 22. Sitting in a Lincoln convertible, the Kennedys and Connallys waved at the large and enthusiastic crowds gathered along the parade route. As their vehicle passed the Texas School Book Depository Building at 12:30 p.m., Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly fired three shots from the sixth floor, fatally wounding President Kennedy and seriously injuring Governor Connally. Kennedy was pronounced dead 30 minutes later at Dallas’ Parkland Hospital. He was 46. [PAR] Vice President Lyndon Johnson, who was three cars behind President Kennedy in the motorcade, was sworn in as the 36th president of the United States at 2:39 p.m. He took the presidential oath of office aboard Air Force One as it sat on the runway at Dallas Love Field airport. The swearing in was witnessed by some 30 people, including Jacqueline Kennedy, who was still wearing clothes stained with her husband’s blood. Seven minutes later, the presidential jet took off for Washington. [PAR] The next day, November 23, President Johnson issued his first proclamation, declaring November 25 to be a day of national mourning for the slain president. On that Monday, hundreds of thousands of people lined the streets of Washington to watch a horse-drawn caisson bear Kennedy’s body from the Capitol Rotunda to St. Matthew’s Catholic Cathedral for a requiem Mass. The solemn procession then continued on to Arlington National Cemetery, where leaders of 99 nations gathered for the state funeral. Kennedy was buried with full military honors on a slope below Arlington House, where an eternal flame was lit by his widow to forever mark the grave. [PAR] Lee Harvey Oswald, born in New Orleans in 1939, joined the U.S. Marines in 1956. He was discharged in 1959 and nine days later left for the Soviet Union, where he tried unsuccessfully to become a citizen. He worked in Minsk and married a Soviet woman and in 1962 was allowed to return to the United States with his wife and infant daughter. In early 1963, he bought a .38 revolver and rifle with a telescopic sight by mail order, and on April 10 in Dallas he allegedly shot at and missed former U.S. Army general Edwin Walker, a figure known for his extreme right-wing views. Later that month, Oswald went to New Orleans and founded a branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, a pro-Castro organization. In September 1963, he went to Mexico City, where investigators allege that he attempted to secure a visa to travel to Cuba or return to the USSR.

May, for a Montgomery Ward promotional childrenï¿½s book. [PAR] There is a widely reproduced story concerning the creation of Rudolph by Robert May.  It is not altogether accurate, but is reproduced here for the sake of completeness. [PAR] Rudolph The Ninth Reindeer [PAR] Rudolph, ""the most famous reindeer of all,"" was born over a hundred years after his eight flying counterparts. The red-nosed wonder was the creation of Robert L. May, a copywriter at the Montgomery Ward department store. In 1939, May wrote a Christmas-themed story-poem to help bring holiday traffic into his store. Using a similar rhyme pattern to Moore's ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas,"" May told the story of Rudolph, a young reindeer who was teased by the other deer because of his large, glowing, red nose. But, When Christmas Eve turned foggy and Santa worried that he wouldn't be able to deliver gifts that night, the former outcast saved Christmas by leading the sleigh by the light of his red nose. Rudolph's message-that given the opportunity, a liability can be turned into an asset-proved popular. Montgomery Ward sold almost two and a half million copies of the story in 1939. When it was reissued in 1946, the book sold over three and half million copies. Several years later, one of May's friends, Johnny Marks, wrote a short song based on Rudolph's story (1949). It was recorded by Gene Autry and sold over two million copies. Since then, the story has been translated into twenty-five languages and been made into a television movie, narrated by Burl Ives, which has charmed audiences every year since 1964. [PAR] Source: The History Channel [PAR] William Studwell, The Christmas Carol Reader [PAR] Reindeer are not a recent topic for Christmas songs. Ever since Clement Moore developed the modern myth of Santa Claus in his 1822 classic ""Twas the Night Before Christmas,"" reindeer have been closely associated with Santa and have been mentioned in carols. As far back as the 1850s or 1860s, Benjamin Hanby alluded to the animals in his ""Up on the Housetop."" Two other holiday songs with reindeer featured were Ken Darby's 1942 musical rendition of Moore's poem and the 1946 hit, ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" by Gene Autry and Oakley Haldeman. [PAR] But Johnny Marks' 1949 phenomenon ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" was a lot more than the mere mention of deer. Rudolph was the first important new Christmas character since Moore's introduction of the magnanimous Christmas elf. The success of Rudolph apparently encouraged the subsequent appearance of other imaginative and lasting fictional personalities such as Frosty the Snowman, the Chipmunks, and the Grinch. In addition, Marks' song, although not the first highly popular novelty carol to appear after World War II, was the supreme prototype of Christmas novelties and possibly served as the impetus for similar songs later on. [PAR] Marks, though, was not the creator of the Rudolph character. In 1939, Marks' brother-in-law, Robert L. May, developed the story of Rudolph as part of an advertising promotion for Montgomery Ward stores [some sources state that it was a children's book; others state that it was a comic book]. [PAR] [It caught the fancy of Hollywood. In either 1942 or 1944 ï¿½ the sources differ ï¿½ a cartoon Rudolph was released.] [PAR] In 1947, Wards graciously gave the copyright for Rudolph to May, who published the tale in book form that year.

Born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child before signing with Jive Records in 1997. Spears's first and second studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), became international successes, with the former becoming the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. Title tracks ""...Baby One More Time"" and ""Oops!... I Did It Again"" broke international sales records. In 2001, Spears released her self-titled third studio album, Britney, and played the starring role in the film Crossroads (2002). She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003), which yielded the worldwide success of the ""Toxic"" single. [PAR] In 2007, Spears's much-publicized personal issues sent her career into hiatus. Her fifth studio album, Blackout, was released later that year, and spawned hits such as ""Gimme More"" and ""Piece of Me"". Her erratic behavior and hospitalizations continued through the following year, at which point she was placed under a still on-going conservatorship. Spears's sixth studio album, Circus (2008), included global chart-topping lead single ""Womanizer"". Its supporting tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears was one of the highest-grossing global concert tours in 2009. Later that October, ""3"" became Spears's third single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

"[DOC] [TLE] Sitting Bull - United States American HistorySitting Bull [PAR] Blog [PAR] Sitting Bull [PAR] Sitting Bull was a medicine man, or holy man, of the Hunkpapa Lakota (Sioux), who were being driven from their land in the Black Hills. He took up arms against the white man, refusing to be transported to the Indian Territory. Under his leadership as a war chief, the Lakota tribes united in their struggle for survival on the northern plains. [PAR] Birth, childhood, and early career [PAR] Sitting Bull was born on the Grand River in present-day South Dakota in 1831. His father bore the name Sitting Bull, and his mother was named Her-Holy-Door. When he was born, his parents named him Jumping Badger. [PAR] As a little boy, Jumping Badger, there was nothing remarkable to set him apart from other children of his tribe. His nickname was Hunkesi, meaning, ""Slow,"" because he never hurried and did everything with care. [PAR] At an early age, however, the boy distinguished himself as a leader. On his first hunt at the age of 10, Jumping Badger killed his first buffalo. He gave the meat away to elders who were unable to hunt for themselves. [PAR] Following the hunt, Jumping Badger set out on his first vision quest. When the lad was just 14, his father gave him a coup stick, a slender wand with which he could gain prestige by touching or striking an enemy in battle. He joined his first war party against the Crow, anxious for a chance to prove himself at that tender age. [PAR] Jumping Badger struck his first Crow warrior with his coup stick, thus earning a coveted measure of bravery in combat. His father was so filled with pride at his son's early victory, that he gave the name Sitting Bull (Tatanka-Iyotanka) to his son as part of the ceremonies celebrating his elevation to warrior status. His new name suggested a stubborn buffalo bull planted unmovable on his haunches. The Indians thought of the buffalo as a headstrong, stubborn creature that was afraid of nothing, a creature that had great endurance, courage and strength. Those were fighting virtues that people saw in Sitting Bull. [PAR] Promising maturity [PAR] As a young man, Sitting Bull successfully increased Sioux hunting grounds. By the age of 25, he was the leader of the Strong Heart Warrior Society and later, a distinguished member of the Silent Eaters, a group concerned with tribal welfare. [PAR] Soon, Sitting Bull became known for his fearlessness in battle. He also was generous and wise, virtues admired by his tribe. As young Sitting Bull matured into adulthood, he accumulated an exceptional war record in fighting with Assiniboins, Crows, Flatheads, Blackfeet, and other enemy tribes. That led, in 1857, to his designation as a tribal war chief. [PAR] At the same time, Sitting Bull mastered the sacred Lakota mysteries. He became as shaman and medicine man, and rose to eminence as a holy man. [PAR] Wives and children [PAR] Sitting Bull had at least three wives, and possibly as many as five over the years. His first two wives died. His last two wives, ï¿½Four Robes"" and ï¿½Seen-by-the-Nation,"" gave him many children. [PAR] In his later years, Sitting Bull's most favored children were a son named Crow Foot and a daughter named Standing Holy. Although a Crow warrior had killed Sitting Bullï¿½s father in 1859, his mother was a powerful presence in his teepee until her death in 1884. [PAR] Later career [PAR] From 1863 to 1868, the U.S. Army continually invaded Lakota territory, especially their hunting grounds, which created problems for the native economy. The Lakota fought the army's encroachment. [PAR] Sitting Bull experienced his first encounter with American soldiers in June 1863, when the army mounted a broad campaign in retaliation for the Santee Rebellion in Minnesota , in which Sitting Bull's people had played no part. The next year, Sitting Bull fought U.S. troops again, at the Battle of Killdeer Mountain. In 1865, he led a siege against the newly established Fort Rice in present-day North Dakota .

Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region.  In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.

Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area, which produces a third of the country's GDP. From the late 12th century, Finland was an integral part of Sweden, a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and its official status. In the spirit of the notion of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson (1791–1858), ""we are no-longer Swedes, we do not want to become Russians, let us therefore be Finns"", the Finnish national identity started to establish. Nevertheless, in 1809, Finland was incorporated into the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland.

It is the second in The Chronicles of Narnia film series from Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, following The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005). The four Pevensie children return to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) in his struggle for the throne against his corrupt uncle, King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto).

Easy, but dead wrong, as Rita herself might say. Despite the advances of feminism, the Shirleys and the Ritas are still with us, over 20 years since Willy Russell first wrote about them with an eager and unpatronising vividness. [PAR] They are, after all, the direct descendents of Ibsen's Nora, slamming the door on their marriages and walking out into the future to discover their real themselves. However, today's Shirley would probably opt for a breast enlargement and Rita seek empowerment through pole-dancing rather than Shakespeare. [PAR] But we are back in the 1980s, so Shirley heads for Greece where she blooms like a flower in the sun, and Rita for the university library where English literature is her nutrient-rich mulch. There is a touch of Billy Elliot about Rita, with Blake standing in for ballet; a hint of Arnold Wesker's Beatie Bryant, too. ""My life has been a crime because I didn'tlive it properly,"" declares Shirley talking of the unused, untended part of herself. ""I want to find myself,"" cries Rita with evangelical zeal. [PAR] Shirley's husband, Joe, and Rita's husband, Denny, are the same ""stranger"" that Tovald is to Nora. Men are defined by their absence even when they are actually present: Shirley's kitchen wall, with whom she converses, is rather more animated than Larry Lamb's alcoholic university tutor, Frank, in Educating Rita, the perky two-hander directed in slightly stuttering fashion by Jeremy Sams. [PAR] The Menier's Willy Russell season offers an opportunity to see both plays, once the staple of every cash-strapped regional rep, in tandem. It's like one big girls'-night-out: warming, soothing and at times raucous and invigorating, if not entirely life-changing. Russell is that rare writer who can make cliches seem new-minted and, in Shirley Valentine at least, has a direct conduit to the bruised but hopeful heart that we all carry around with us.

"[DOC] [TLE] Gunfight at the O.K. Corral - Weird U.S.Weird Arizona [PAR]   [PAR] Gunfight at the O.K. Corral [PAR] The most famous event to occur in Tombstone is comparatively trivial in the grand scheme of American history, but the notorious Gunfight at the O.K. Corral remains the most renowned incident in the entire chronicle of the Wild West. The name of the site where it took place, as well as the names of those involved, are recognized around the world, and have been immortalized in countless books, films and TV shows. [PAR] Unfortunately, the precise details of the shootout that took place October 26, 1881, are mostly uncertain, as there was much disagreement in the [PAR] testimony of both eyewitnesses and those involved, not to mention Hollywood's numerous convolutions since. What we do know, however, is that two parties––Doc Holliday and brothers Virgil, Wyatt and Morgan Earp on one side, and on the other, Billy Claiborne, brothers Ike and Billy Clanton, and brothers Frank and Tom McLaury––engaged in an armed confrontation fueled by blame, loyalty and ego. [PAR] The nine men faced off following an escalating series of run-ins that began hours earlier. Doc Holliday had provoked Ike Clanton the night before, probably concerning a months-old disagreement over a stagecoach robbery, of which Clanton accused Holliday. After the dispute ended with the help of the Earp brothers, with whom Clanton had already experienced friction, Clanton angrily threatened both Holliday and the Earps. The next day, Clanton staggered around town fully armed, drunkenly announcing he was looking for any one of them. Virgil Earp, who was city marshal, and Morgan Earp, a deputy, found Clanton that afternoon, pistol-whipped him and took him to court for illegally carrying firearms within the city. [PAR] Shortly thereafter, Wyatt Earp had his own run-in with Tom McLaury, Clanton's cohort. Wyatt accused McLaury of being illegally armed himself and tried to provoke him into drawing the hidden pistol Wyatt believed he was carrying. McLaury never revealed said pistol, but the clash ended with Wyatt pistol-whipping McLaury. Wyatt was not able to arrest him, however, as Wyatt was not officially an officer of the law. [PAR] Sometime after that, Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury arrived in town after hearing about the trouble the previous night and were intent on backing up their brothers. Both were armed, and as such, were required to deposit their weapons at the [PAR] first hotel, saloon or stable they came to. Hearing about their arrival, Virgil sought them out, supported by his brothers and by Doc Holliday, to make sure they did so. [PAR] By the time Holliday and the Earps found Billy and Frank, the two men had been joined by Tom, Ike and Billy Claiborne. Words were quickly exchanged. Then so were bullets. No one can say for sure who fired first, but in less than 30 seconds, Virgil, Morgan and Holliday stood injured, while Billy Clanton and both McLaurys lay dead. [PAR] While popular history remembers Holliday and the Earps as the good guys in the dispute, there are those who believe Clanton and the McLaurys had been unjustly killed in a blatant abuse of power. The Earps insisted the victims had been illegally armed, but detractors say that was just an excuse for murder. Some argue Frank and Billy hadn't yet had a chance to deposit their weapons as required, and disparities in testimony make it difficult to determine whether Tom had actually been armed as Wyatt believed him to be. Plus, Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp would have been guilty of illegally carrying weapons themselves, since neither one was an officer of the law, as were Morgan and Virgil. Still, it's believed the victims held a grudge with the Earps to begin with and were deliberately looking for a fight. [PAR] Visitors to Tombstone can visit the site made famous by the incident, which stands on Allen Street as it did in the 1880s. Be aware, however, that the shootout didn't actually take place there. In reality, the whole thing occurred on a section of vacant property out back, along Fremont Street. The O.K. Corral just made for a better title than The Gunfight",The Gunfight at the O.K.

"[DOC] [TLE] Which metal is the best conductor of electricity ...Which metal is the best conductor of electricity? | Reference.com [PAR] Which metal is the best conductor of electricity? [PAR] A: [PAR] Quick Answer [PAR] Silver is the most electrically and thermally conductive metal. Other metals with a high level of electrical conductivity are copper and gold. [PAR] Full Answer [PAR] Conductivity is measured by an element's ability to transmit energy. If an element is considered to be electrically conductive, it means that it has the ability to conduct electricity. Thermal conductivity refers to the transfer of heat. Most metals are able to conduct electricity. [PAR] Although silver is the most electrically conductive element, copper and gold are more commonly used in wiring and electronics. Copper is used because it is less expensive. Gold is used because it does not corrode as easily as other metals. Nickel, iron, platinum, zinc and aluminum also have high electrical conductivity. Alloys like bronze and brass are also electrically conductive.[DOC] [TLE] What Is the Most Conductive Element? - About.com EducationWhat Is the Most Conductive Element? [PAR] What Is the Most Conductive Element? [PAR] What Is the Most Conductive Element? [PAR] The Element That Is the Best Conductor of Electricity [PAR] Silver has the highest electrical conductivity of any element.  Alchemist-hp, Creative Commons License [PAR] Updated March 09, 2016. [PAR] Question: What Is the Most Conductive Element? [PAR] Conductivity refers to the ability of a material to transmit energy. There are different types of conductivity, including electrical conductivity , thermal conductivity and acoustical conductivity. Here is a look at the three most electrically conductive elements. As you might expect, all three conductive elements are metals. [PAR] Answer: The most electrically conductive element is silver , followed by copper and gold. Silver also has the highest thermal conductivity of any element and the highest light reflectance. Although it is the best conductor , copper and gold are used more often in electrical applications because copper is less expensive and gold has a much higher corrosion resistance. Because silver tarnishes, it is less desirable for high frequencies because the exterior surface is less conductive. [PAR] As to why silver is the best conductor, the answer is that its electrons are more free to move than those of the other elements. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Test Your General Science Knowledge [PAR] This has to do with its valence and crystal structure. [PAR] Most metals conduct electricity. Other elements with high electrical conductivity, are aluminum, zinc, nickel, iron and platinum. Brass and bronze are electrically conductive alloys , rather than elements. [PAR] Table of the Conductive Order of Metals [PAR] This list of electric conductivity includes alloys as well as pure elements. Because the size and shape of a substance affects its conductivity, the list assumes all samples are the same size. [PAR] Rank [PAR] Factors That Affect Electrical Conductivity [PAR] Certain factors can affect how well a material conducts electricity. [PAR] Temperature - Changing temperature of silver or any other conductor alters its conductivity. In general, increasing the temperature causes thermal excitation of the atoms and decreases conductivity (increases resistivity). The relationship is linear, but it breaks down at low temperatures. [PAR] Impurities - Adding an impurity to a conductor decreases its conductivity. For example, sterling silver is not as good of a conductor as pure silver. Oxidized silver is not as good a conductor as untarnished silver. Impurities hinder electron flow. [PAR] Crystal Structure and Phases - If there are different phases within a material, conductivity will slow slightly at the interface and may be different from one structure than another. The way a material has been processed can affect how well it conducts electricity. [PAR] Electromagnetic Fields - Conductors generate their own electromagnetic fields when electricity runs through them, with the magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field. External electromagnetic fields can produce magnetoresistance, which can slow the flow of current. [PAR] Frequency - The number of oscillation cycles an alternating electrical current completes per second is its frequency in hertz. Above a certain level, a high frequency can cause current to flow around a conductor rather than through it (skin effect). Since there is no oscillation and hence no frequency, the skin effect does not occur with",Which element is the best conductor of electricity?,['silver'],91be1b5afda849369f6e829723bbf7df,"[{'end': [1940, 2228, 3251, 3607, 2353, 3652, 690, 225, 1324, 1902, 3669, 3718], 'start': [1935, 2223, 3246, 3602, 2348, 3647, 685, 220, 1319, 1897, 3664, 3713]}]",∃x BestConductorOfElectricity(x)

Methuselah is not a major figure in the Bible; he is mentioned only in passing in Genesis, 1 Chronicles 1:3, and Luke 3:37.  According to the King James version of Genesis 5:25-27, “And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech. And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.” Lamech was the father of Noah, making Metheselah Noah’s grandfather.  Biblical scholars say Methuselah died in the year of the Great Flood, though the Bible gives no indication whether the old man was a victim of the flood itself.  Luke 3:37 traces the lineage of Jesus of Nazareth back through Noah and Methuselah to Adam.  The name of Methuselah is now a synonym for any old or long-lasting person. [PAR] Extra credit [PAR] Methuselah is mentioned in the lyrics to “It Ain’t Necessarily So” from the George Gershwin musical Porgy and Bess: “Methus’lah lived nine hundred years / Methus’lah lived nine hundred years / But who calls dat livin’ / When no gal will give in / To no man what’s nine hundred years.” [PAR]      [DOC] [TLE] Methuselah in the Bible - Oldest Man Who Ever LivedMethuselah in the Bible - Oldest Man Who Ever Lived [PAR] By  Jack Zavada [PAR] Methuselah has fascinated Bible readers for centuries as the oldest man who ever lived.  According to Genesis 5:27, Methuselah was 969 years old when he died. [PAR] Three possible meanings have been suggested for his name: ""man of the spear (or dart),"" ""his death shall bring...,"" and ""worshiper of Selah.""  The second meaning may imply that when Methuselah died, judgment would come, in the form of the Flood . [PAR] Methuselah was a descendant of Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve .  Methuselah's father was Enoch , his son was Lamech, and his grandson was Noah , who built the ark and rescued his family from the great Flood. [PAR] Before the Flood, people lived extremely long lives: Adam, 930; Seth, 912; Enosh, 905; Lamech, 777; and Noah, 950.  Enoch, Methuselah's father, was ""translated"" to heaven at age 365. [PAR] Bible scholars offer a number of theories as to why Methuselah lived so long.  One is that the pre-Flood patriarchs were only a few generations removed from Adam and Eve, a genetically perfect couple. [PAR]   They would have had unusually strong immunity from disease and life-threatening conditions.  Another theory suggests that early in humanity's history, people lived longer to populate the earth. [PAR] As sin increased in the world, however, God planned to bring judgment through the Flood: [PAR] Then the LORD said, “My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years.” (Genesis 6:3, NIV ) [PAR] Although several people lived to be over 400 years old after the Flood ( Genesis 11:10-24 ), gradually the maximum human lifespan went down to about 120 years.  The Fall of Man and the subsequent sin it introduced into the world corrupted every aspect of the planet.  [PAR] ""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" (Romans 6:23, NIV )  [PAR] Paul was speaking about both physical and spiritual death. [PAR] The Bible does not indicate that Methuselah's character had anything to do with his long life.  Certainly he would have been influenced by the example of his righteous father Enoch, who pleased God so much he escaped death by being ""taken up"" to heaven.

"[DOC] [TLE] The Homes of Winston Churchill - Find House SittersHomes of Winston Churchill [PAR]   [PAR] The Homes of Winston Churchill [PAR] Sir Winston Churchill was a politician, soldier, historian, accomplished artist and Nobel Prize winning writer, recently voted the greatest Briton of all time.  His life started and ended in two beautiful, historic buildings in the  English countryside, both of which are open to visitors: his birthplace, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire and his family home in later life, Chartwell in Kent. [PAR]  Winston Churchill was never meant to be born at Blenheim Palace.  His parents fully intended him to be born at their London home but “a rather imprudent and rough drive in a pony carriage�? brought on the birth two months early. This unfortunate incident couldn’t have happened in nicer  surroundings.  Winston Churchill was born on 30th November 1874 in a small room off the Great Hall in the home of his grandparents, the 7th Duke and Duchess of Marlborough.  The palace is a grand and expansive country home situated in Woodstock, a small village in the Cotswolds area of Oxfordshire. Construction work on this magnificent house started in 1705.  The palace was a generous gift both from a monarch, Queen Anne, and a grateful nation following the first Duke of Marlborough’s victory over the French at the Battle of Blenheim in Germany.  The Duke returned a national hero and the queen secured a grant of £240,000 (equivalent to approximately £33 million now) to fund the 17 years of building works. [PAR]  The time taken to fully appreciate all that Blenheim Palace has to offer should not be underestimated.  The exquisite Baroque palace is situated in 2100 acres of parkland designed by the famous English landscaper, Lancelot “Capability�? Brown.  The grounds include a small summerhouse known as the “Temple of Diana�? where Winston Churchill proposed to his future wife, Clementine Hozier.  They were married just  over a month later in Westminster.  The tour around the palace itself starts in the Great Hall complete with painted ceilings and stone carvings, before moving on to state rooms and drawing rooms full of tapestries, porcelain, paintings and furniture.  The room known as the “Long Library�? is the palace’s finest, designed by Christopher Wren and 55 meters in length. [PAR]  Providing an interesting contrast to the grandeur and opulence of Blenheim Palace, Chartwell in  Kent was Churchill’s main home from 1922 until his death in 1965.  Whilst certainly a large house by anyone’s standards, it has a much more homely feel with touches such as a children’s playhouse in the expansive gardens and a wall that Winston built himself, proudly inscribing his name on it. [PAR]  Churchill purchased Chartwell for £5000, when his wife was heavily pregnant with their youngest child, and then spent three times as much on restoration.  During the  Second World War, Chartwell was abandoned due to its location in South-East England, an area subject to heavy bombing.  At the end of the war, despite being a national hero, Churchill was defeated in an election and was unable to afford the cost of running Chartwell due to his reduced income.  Much to his relief, a consortium of his friends offered to buy the property and the Churchills were able to continue to live there paying only a nominal rent.  [PAR] The British National  Trust now owns Chartwell, after the consortium presented the property to the nation in 1966, and the house remains much as it was when Churchill lived there.  Many personal mementos around the house evoke the memory of this great statesman – his paintings in the garden studio, his books in the library and pictures of Churchill with famous visitors to Chartwell including Charlie Chaplin and Lawrence of Arabia.  The grounds include Lady Clementine Churchill’s rose garden, the  lakes Churchill himself created and the Golden Rose Walk, a Golden Wedding anniversary gift from their children.  Chartwell was clearly somewhere where Churchill loved to spend time as he commented that “a day away from Chartwell is a day wasted�?.

"[DOC] [TLE] Green Green Grass Of Home by Tom Jones SongfactsGreen Green Grass Of Home by Tom Jones Songfacts [PAR] Green Green Grass Of Home by Tom Jones Songfacts [PAR] Songfacts [PAR] This country song about a condemned prisoner who longs to escape to the green, green grass of home was inspired by a crime scene in the film The Asphalt Jungle. Nashville songwriter Curly Putnam wrote it in 1964 and it was initially recorded by country singer Johnny Darrell. [PAR] Tom Jones decided to record this after hearing a version by Jerry Lee Lewis, a legendary Rocker who had started making Country records. A year after Johnny Darrell's original version, Lewis recorded this on his album Country Songs For City Folks. [PAR] Jones recalled to The Mail On Sunday February 6, 2011: ""I used to collect anything Jerry Lee Lewis recorded, and still do. I was in New York in 1965 when I bought his country album Country Songs For City Folks. Green Green Grass Of Home stuck out. [PAR] I got on well with Jerry Lee. I did have a bit of a dust-up with him one night in Vegas, but most of the time, we got on great. He came over to do a British tour in 1966 and I had just recorded the song. He told me he'd love to hear it, so I played it to him in his hotel room. He was knocked out with it and said: 'You've done something different here, the arrangement is great. It sounds like a No 1 to me.' I said: 'I hope you're right.' He was."" [PAR] Jones discussed the song's meaning with The Mail On Sunday: ""I think the lyrical content is important here. The guy in the song is really in a jail cell, but you don't know until the end. That got to me. Good God, it paints a picture and yet a lot of people who love Green Green Grass Of Home don't even realise that. This is about a man who is going to be hanged and he's just reminiscing on the precious parts of his life. [PAR] It made me think of Wales when I recorded it – 'the old home town looks the same'. When I went back to Pontypridd in those days, getting off the train from London, those words would ring true. It seems like a lot of people relate the sentiment to their home too."" [PAR] Tom Jones recalled hearing Jerry Lee Lewis' version of this in 1000 UK #1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, ""I said to my recording manager, Peter Sullivan, I'd like to record this. He said, 'A Country song?' I said 'Yeah' because I hadn't done a Country song up to that point. Les Reed did the arrangement and played piano on the track and made it more of a Pop song than a Country song, because when Jerry Lee Lewis did it, it was strict Country. When I came back to England, I recorded the song on TV and we did it like in a jail. But you don't know it is a jail until the camera pulls back and you see the bars, and there I am in this jail singing The Green Green Grass Of Home."" [PAR] This was Tom Jones' biggest hit in the UK, selling 1,205,000 copies. It was the first Decca single by a UK artist to sell more than a million copies in the UK. [PAR] Artists to cover this song include Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Joan Baez and Kenny Rogers.

"[DOC] [TLE] Lieutenant GreenLieutenant Green is a fictional character in the 1960s British Supermarionation television series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and its 2000s computer-animated remake, Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet. [PAR] In both series, Green serves as the personal assistant to Spectrum commander-in-chief Colonel White, and is shown to be an expert in computer programming and electronics. In the former, he is a native of Trinidad and Tobago,  and as well as being the only non-white male officer on Cloudbase, he is the only lieutenant among its personnel. In the latter, the character is re-imagined as an African-American woman. The original Green is the only black male character to be given a substantial role in a Gerry Anderson series.  [PAR] Appearances [PAR] Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons [PAR] In the original TV series, Green (born Seymour Griffiths) spends most of his time in the Cloudbase control room. He assists Colonel White in the execution of Spectrum assignments by accessing data and radio links from a large supercomputer, which he operates from a moveable chair. At White's command, Green can activate the control room's display screen or speak on the base's public address system. Green rarely leaves Cloudbase, although he occasionally mentions how he would relish an opportunity to meet primary Mysteron agent Captain Black ""face-to-face"". Other Cloudbase personnel assist White whenever the Lieutenant is absent. [PAR] The character's voice was provided by Guyanese actor and singer Cy Grant, on whom the puppet's appearance was based.  He was known to the series creators, Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, for his regular calypso musical contributions to the current affairs programme Tonight. [PAR] Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet [PAR] In the remake series, Green (born Serena Lewis) is re-imagined as a 27-year-old, female, African-American officer, originally from Texas. She remains confined to Skybase (the new series' Cloudbase), but her desk is smaller and her computer uses holographic technology. She is knowledgeable about all aspects of Spectrum, and used to work for the United Nations. Green is attracted to Captain Blue. At the end of the episode 'Proteus', she is offered a promotion to the rank of captain but elects to remain a lieutenant. [PAR] Reception [PAR] During a UK repeat run in 1993, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons became the subject of discussion regarding black-and-white dualism for its use of the codenames ""White"" (to designate the benevolent commander-in-chief of Spectrum, Colonel White), and ""Black"" (to designate the villainous Captain Black).   Series creator Gerry Anderson responded to accusations of political incorrectness and racial stereotyping by pointing out that Lieutenant Green – and the other non-white regulars, Melody and Harmony Angels – are heroic characters of African and Asian backgrounds. [PAR] Green's original voice actor, Cy Grant, considered Captain Scarlet to be of positive multicultural value and commented on its possible allegorical nature.  With regard to dualism, he suggested that ""the 'darkness' of the Mysterons is most easily seen as the psychological rift—the struggle of 'good' and 'evil' — of the Western world as personified by Colonel White and his team. Dark and light are but aspects of each other. Incidentally, green is the colour of nature that can heal that rift."" He also discussed the notion of Green being an African trickster hero.  [PAR] The progressiveness of Green's characterisation has been well received. Mike Fillis of Cult Times praises the Andersons' decision to make a black character the ""second-in-command"" onboard Cloudbase.  Kurt Barling, author of Grant's obituary for The Independent, writes that Green was ""one of the first positive black fictional characters in children's television"".  He praises the character's vocal delivery, arguing that Grant's ""mellifluous tones"" provided Green with a ""serene and heroic quality"".

[PAR] Othello: [PAR] Read on Owl Eyes [PAR] This eText is now on Owl Eyes. Clicking this link will open a new window. [PAR] The notion that jealousy is green-eyed is probably older than Shakespeare, although Shakespeare is our earliest authority in print. In The Merchant of Venice, Portia refers to ""green-eyed jealousy"" (Act 3, scene 2), and here Shakespeare coins the more intense phrase ""green-ey'd monster."" Renaissance Englishmen often paired colors with emotions or personal qualities: both green and yellow are emblematic of jealousy, and green is also emblematic of envy. Some colors are associated with the bodily fluids or ""humors"" thought to make up the temperament; green and black were the colors attributed to bile. [PAR] Iago's basic idea is that the fortunate man knows his wife is cheating; the unfortunate man only suspects it, and is caught between the jaws of affection and anxiety. History and Shakespeare's infinity of cuckold jokes testify that Renaissance men were particularly prone to suspect their wives. The social perils of cuckoldry were severe indeed: it ruined a man's credit and debased his wife. Such consequences produced an advanced state of jealous suspicion known as ""horn-madness,"" named after the metaphorical horns that were supposed to sprout from the cuckold's brow.[DOC] [TLE] “Green-eyed monster” - William Shakespeare - life, quotes ...“Green-eyed monster” - William Shakespeare - life, quotes, facts, etc. - a website dedicated to William Shakespeare [PAR] O, beware, my lord, of jealousy; [PAR] It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock [PAR] The meat it feeds on.

[PAR] Galliano, the son of a Spanish plumber, at age six moved with his family from Gibraltar to south London, where he was educated. At age 16 he left Wilson’s Grammar School for Boys, where he had been an undistinguished student, to study textile design at East London College. In 1980 he entered St. Martin’s School of Art, London, where he became enamoured of historical costuming. His 1984 graduate collection, Les Incroyables, inspired by the French Revolution , was purchased straight off the college’s catwalk by the owner of an exclusive London fashion boutique. After graduating with first-class honours, Galliano set up a studio in a warehouse in London’s East End and established himself as the “boy wonder” of British fashion. He was British Fashion Council Designer of the Year in 1987 and 1994, and in 1991 he made his Paris catwalk debut. [PAR] Twice bankrupted, Galliano’s business was rescued in 1994 by John A. Bult, a Swiss-born New York-based investment banker, and Galliano was set up in an atelier near Place de la Bastille in Paris. In 1995 Galliano was appointed to replace Hubert de Givenchy , the refined founder of the house. Galliano revealed his first couture collection featuring sumptuous bouffant ball gowns, bowed dresses, and belted suits, and in 1995, for the third time and second consecutive year, he was named British Designer of the Year. [PAR] Upon Galliano’s appointment as designer in chief at Dior fashion house in 1996, the luxury-goods conglomerate Louis Vuitton Möet Hennessy (LVMH) bought Galliano’s company from Bult. Bernard Arnault , head of LMVH, which owned both Givenchy and Dior, hoped that the then 36-year-old Galliano would attract a younger clientele , not only to couture but also to the seasonal ready-to-wear lines produced by both houses. Indeed, the arrival of Galliano heralded a fresh start for the beleaguered reputation of haute couture and, as designer in chief of two fashion houses, Galliano enjoyed an unrivaled position among British designers. He confessed, however, that Dior’s New Look—an ensemble that paired jackets with padded shoulders and ample ankle-length skirts—was closer to his own aesthetic than were the conservative linear designs of Givenchy. [PAR] In 1996 English fashion designer Alexander McQueen succeeded Galliano at Givenchy, and the following year they jointly received the British Designer of the Year award.

"[DOC] [TLE] Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - Question.comCharlie and the Chocolate Factory - Question.com [PAR] Home › When was the first Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film made? [PAR] When was the first Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film made? [PAR] The first movie version of Roald    Dahl 's children's book Charlie    and the Chocolate Factory was made in 1971 and entitled Willy Wonka    and the Chocolate Factory. Actor Gene    Wilder played the eccentric character of Willy    Wonka , and with a success on Broadway already behind him, including a role in the Broadway production of One Flew    Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1963), his appearance in Willy Wonka and the    Chocolate Factory cemented his career. Prior to Willy Wonka, Wilder    played roles in films Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and The Producers (1968), and later in Woody Allen 's Everything    You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, and Blazing Saddles. The    2005 version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory stars Johnny    Depp . [PAR] For Peter Ostrum, the boy who played Charlie Bucket, Willy Wonka and the    Chocolate Factory was his first and last movie. Although offered a multiple-movie    contract after his appearance, he turned it down and is now a large-animal veterinarian. [PAR] The movie tells the story of the reclusive candymaker, Willy Wonka, who surprises    the world by announcing that five people who find golden tickets wrapped with    his merchandise will be treated to a full tour of his factory and its secrets.    From a desperately poor family, young Charlie Bucket can barely afford to buy    one chocolate bar, but when he does, it contains a winning ticket! Thus begins    Charlie's fantastic adventure into the world of Willy Wonka, with disaster befalling    those who cross him and a test of spirit for Charlie. Will he manage to beat    the odds and win the ultimate prize? [PAR] Charlie and the Chocolate Factory [PAR] Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was remade in 2005, starring versatile    actor Johnny Depp. Depp has often collaborated with director Tim Burton, including    the memorable Edward Scissorhands (1990), as well as Ed Wood (1994) and Sleepy Hollow (1999). Depp appeared in the 1984 horror classic A Nightmare On Elm Street, but gained his popularity in the 1980s television    series 21 Jump Street. Charlie Bucket is played by young actor Freddie    Highmore, who at age 13 already has an impressive list of credits, including    previous work with Johnny Depp in Finding Neverland. [PAR] Roald Dahl and the Candy Wars [PAR] On one level the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a typically    cautionary children's tale of the consequences of bad behavior. However, according    to a story published on canada.com on July 19, 2005, Roald Dahl had a much more    worldly premise in mind. Drawing on information found in Dahl's autobiography, Boy, the canada.com article notes that the author had a lifelong obsession    with sweets and those who make them. Growing up at a time when candy was made    by family-owned, one-off candy stores, Dahl was dismayed by the shift towards    large corporations manufacturing product en masse. Candy was no longer    special, but merely another commodity. [PAR] Dahl also parodies the intense competition of the chocolate world by making    Willy Wonka's factory a closed, secretive place, where no workers ever seem    to arrive or leave. In the real world, because candy recipes cannot be patented,    a practice of spying and stealing has sprung up between rival companies.    The story in canada.com cites the example of a member of the Mars family stealing    the idea of an American chocolate bar, renaming it and releasing it in the United    Kingdom, where it remains popular today. [PAR] Depp's Version of Willy Wonka [PAR] Shortly after the recent movie's release, several reports came out that Depp    had based his portrayal of Willy Wonka on Michael    Jackson . Reportedly, Depp has denied this and has insisted that he formed    the role based on children's hosts such as Captain Kangaroo, Mr. Rogers and    Uncle Al, whom he","In the 1971 movie Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Willy Wonka is played by Gene Wilder.

With Cary Grant's talent for madcap comedy, with hilariously sinister performances by Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre, with two adorable old ladies who have a very dark secret, plus half-a-dozen other eccentric characters, all involved in a complicated and unpredictable plot, this is a comic masterpiece.  Director Frank Capra keeps everything moving and adds his own touch, keeping some dark material entirely light-hearted. [PAR] This is the kind of movie for which mere analysis cannot do justice to how well everything fits together.  The characters, cast, and writing are all perfect, and the crazy story gives every character some great moments.  There is plenty of witty dialogue, lots of funny slapstick and physical humor, and quite a few wild plot developments.  None of it is meant to be plausible, but it is all hugely entertaining, and done with such skill that it is easy to suspend disbelief.  If you happen not to have seen this before, stick with it for the first few minutes, until you arrive at the home of Cary Grant's two aunts, and then things will take off quickly. [PAR] If you enjoy morbid humor, ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" is an absolute must-see. [PAR] Was the above review useful to you? [PAR] 66 out of 77 people found the following review useful: [PAR] Frank Capra having fun [PAR] from Boston, MA [PAR] 23 July 2004 [PAR] Cary Grant should have had his second Academy Award before he filmed Arsenic and Old Lace. After, he should have taken home his third for best Actor in one of his best comedic performances in his amazing career. Arsenic and Old Lace takes place pretty much in one location. A stage comedy, the movie does justice to its original theatrical version. Cary Grant makes you laugh, even an audience 50 and 60 years after its original release. The story of innocent guilt and laughable situations, other movies like What's Up Doc, Marvin's Room, and even Lake Placid (with its moments of ignorance and bliss) have all stolen moments of Arsenic and Old Lace. No one but Cary Grant could have starred in this movie. A delightful performance and an over the top comedic talent was showcased in this comedy classic. [PAR] Was the above review useful to you? [PAR] 59 out of 74 people found the following review useful: [PAR] The Brooklyn Brewsters [PAR] from New York [PAR] 15 May 2005 [PAR] ""Arsenic and Old Lace"", one of the best stage comedies that were seen on Broadway, gets the royal treatment via Frank Capra, a man that was born to direct the movie version, if ever there was a man to do so. The play written by Joseph Kisserling was given an excellent screen play treatment by the Julius and Philip Epstein team, two great movie adapters of all time. [PAR] This is a combination of a madcap and a screwball comedy. The first best thing in the film are the star turn performances by two of the original actresses that created the roles of Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha, Josephine Hull and Jean Adair, respectively. Just to see the Brewster sisters in action is worth the price of admission. These two women had the roles of a career by bringing life into the two kinds souls living in Brooklyn and doing good, as well as ""helping lonely old men"" to find happiness. [PAR] The second best reason for watching the film is Cary Grant. This is without a doubt one of the actor's best achievements in his long career in the movies! Mr. Grant plays Mortimer Brewster, a man that hates the idea of getting married and losing his freedom. That is, until the beautiful Elaine comes along.

"[DOC] [TLE] About Mongooses - Virginia TechAbout Mongooses [PAR]   [PAR] Rudyard Kipling accorded an everlasting place      in literature for the mongoose, when he created Rikki-tikki-tavi (1884), the      heroic mongoose who kills a cobra and saves a child's life. Since earliest      times the mongoose, with its characteristics of courage and cunning, strength,      ferocity and curiosity, has been featured in religious myths and legends. ""Run and find out!"" is the motto      of Rikki-tikki-tavi, a true mongoose.. [PAR] The mongoose is a member of the Mustelid family      and is found on all continents except Australia and Antarctica. With its amazing      combinations of colors and patterns, beautiful fur and elegant movements the      mongoose is among the most appealing of Mustelid mammals. Ancient Egyptians      considered the mongoose a sacred animal and believed that the mongoose would      break crocodile eggs thereby reducing the number of crocodiles living in the      Nile. Ancient Egyptians often kept a mongoose to kill poisonous snakes. Today,      mongooses are kept as pets, particularly in tropical Asia. A mongoose fighting      a cobra is still an occurrence in many East Asia towns. [PAR] Kipling may have borrowed his idea of Rikki-tikki-tavi      from the Arabic fable ""The Faithful Mongoose."" In this fable a Brahmin goes      out to the country, leaving his pet mongoose to protect his baby. A venomous      snake enters his home and the mongoose kills it. When the Brahmin returns,      the mongoose runs to greet him and the Brahmin, seeing blood on the mongooseï¿½s      nose believes that he has attacked his son. The Brahmin kills the mongoose      in his rage. Too late, he finds his son asleep and safe, with the snake lying      dead by his cradle. Kipling however, does not create a dark ending for his      heroic mongoose. What follows are exerts from Kipling's story of RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI: [PAR] It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten      a mongoose, because he is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto      of all the mongoose family is ""Run and find out,"" and Rikki-tikki-tavi was      a true mongoose. He was a restless companion, because he had to get up and      attend to every noise all through the night and find out what made it. Every      mongoose always hopes to be a house-mongoose some day and have rooms to run      about in; and Rikki-tikki's mother (she used to live in the General's house      at Segowlieh) had carefully told Rikki what to do if ever he came across white      men. [PAR] This is the story of the Great War that Rikki-tikki-tavi      fought single-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlie      cantonment. Darzee the Tailorbird helped him, and Chuchumdra the Muskrat,      who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but always creeps round      by the wall gave him advice, but Kikki-tikki did the real fighting. [PAR] He was a mongoose, rather like a little cat      in his fur and his tail, but quite like a weasel in his head and his habits.      His eyes and the end of his restless nose were pink; he could scratch himself      anywhere he pleased with any leg, front or back, that he chose to use; he      could fluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle-brush, and his war-cry      as he scuttled through the long grass was: Rikki-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk! [PAR] The bite paralysed Karait, and Rikki-tikki      was just going to eat him up from the tail, after the custom of his family      at dinner, when he remembered that a full meal makes a slow mongoose, and      if he wanted all his strength and quickness ready, he must keep himself thin.

"[DOC] [TLE] Greenland | Blog of Maps of Worldmapsofworld Leave a comment [PAR] What is Greenland? [PAR] Greenland is an autonomous constituent country in the Kingdom of Denmark, and the largest island in the world that is not a continent. Greenland is a dependency of the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland is known locally as Kalaallit Nunaat, and is inhabited by indigenous Inuit people as well as people of Danish descent. [PAR] When was Greenland colonized? [PAR] Erik the Red, or Erik Thorvaldsson from Scandinavia, is credited with being the first European to settle the island in the 10th century, after being exiled. The Inuits arrived in the 13th century, settling in other parts of the coast. The Norse abandoned their settlements in the 15th century, probably because of harsh conditions and lack of food sources. The Danish-Norweigians arrived in the 18th century, after years of exploration to attempt to relocate the lost Nordic settlements. Greenland became a Danish colony in on January 14, 1814. [PAR] This was followed by periods of occupation by both Nazi Germany and the United States during World War II before it finally became part of the Kingdom of Denmark in 1953. Greenland joined the European Union with Denmark in 1973, but eventually left in 1985 because of the EU’s fishing restrictions. Greenland was allowed self-government in 1979 (home rule), and voted to increase their autonomy in 2008. Responsibility for their own internal affairs was granted in 2009. Denmark continues to handle Greenland’s foreign affairs, security, and finances. [PAR] What form of government does Greenland have? [PAR] Greenland has a parliamentary democracy within the constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Denmark. [PAR] How did Greenland get its name? [PAR] Erik the Red gave Greenland its name in hopes of enticing settlers to move to the island, which they believed was beautiful and green. He had been exiled from his homeland, Iceland, for murder, and when he returned to Iceland he lured people to help him build a colony on Greenland. [PAR] Where is Greenland? [PAR] Greenland is considered part of North America, located between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. Greenland is situated northeast of Canada, its nearest neighbor, and west of Iceland. [PAR] Though Greenland is geographically North American, it is politically and culturally associated with Europe. [PAR] How big is Greenland? [PAR] Greenland is the 12th largest country in the world, with a size of 2,166,086 square kilometers, making it the world’s largest island that is not a continent. [PAR] What are the main features of Greenland’s geography? [PAR] Greenland is the world’s largest island that is not a continent, though some scientists believe that Greenland is actually an archipelago connected by ice. [PAR] Most of Greenland (about 81%) is covered in ice, except for a narrow strip of coastline around the island, where all Greenland’s cities are located. The Greenland Ice Sheet is the second largest ice sheet on Earth, behind the Antarctic Ice sheet. The weight of the ice sheet had caused much of Greenland to sink about 300 meters below sea level. [PAR] Greenland is home to a vast national park, which covers up about 46% of the island in the northeast corner. Northeast Greenland National park is both the largest and farthest north national park in the world. [PAR] How many timezones does Greenland have? [PAR] Greenland spans four time zones. [PAR] What is the population of Greenland? [PAR] Greenland is one of the least densely populated countries in the world, with a population of approximately 57,000. [PAR] What is the capital of Greenland? [PAR] The capital of Greenland is called Nuuk, which means “the promontory.” The city is also known as Godthab, meaning “good hope” in Danish, and is one of the smallest capital cities in the world.

[PAR] Originally Written By: Leo J [PAR] Revised By: A. Joseph [PAR] Last Modified Date: 12 December 2016 [PAR] Copyright Protected: [PAR] These 10 animal facts will amaze you [PAR] Track and field is a sport that includes includes many events, most of which fall under one of the two categories: track or field. Track events are those in which the athletes compete by running. Field events are those in which the athletes jump, vault or throw an object. Some events, such as the decathlon and heptathlon, are composed of multiple other events. Common track and field events include dashes, relays, hurdles, the long jump and the high jump , among others. [PAR] Track Events [PAR] In most cases, track events are measured in meters, although some minor levels of track and field, such as competitions for children, might measure events in yards. The shorter track events are called dashes or sprints. Some of the common distances for dashes are 50, 55, 60, 100, 200 and 400 meters. On standard-size tracks, one lap is 400 meters. [PAR] Races that are 800, 1,500, 1,600 or 3,200 meters long are often referred to as middle distance events. The most common distance events, or long-distance events, include the 5,000- and 10,000-meter runs. Some competitions might include races that are even longer. The marathon , which is 26.2 miles (42.2 km), is considered a track and field event in some competitions, such as the Olympics . [PAR] Relays are events in which four teammates run, one at a time, passing a small baton from one runner to the next. The three most common distances for relays are totals of 400, 800 or 1,600 meters. These races are often identified by the number of runners and the distance they each run, rather than the total distance of the race. So, for example, the 800-meter relay might be called the 4x200 relay — typically pronounced as ""four by 200 relay."" [PAR] Hurdle events also are held on tracks, and the athletes must leap over the evenly spaced hurdles as they run. Common distances include the 60-, 110-, 300- and 400-meter hurdles for boys or men and the 60-, 100-, 300- and 400-meter hurdles for girls or women. These races are sometimes identified by their distance and either ""high hurdles,"" ""intermediate hurdles"" or ""low hurdles."" The shorter the race, the greater the height of the hurdles, in most cases. For example, the hurdles might be 42 inches (106.7 cm) high for a men's 110 hurdles race and 36 inches (91.4 cm) for a men's 400 hurdles competition. [PAR] Field Events [PAR] The field events include four in which the athletes throw objects: discus, shot put , hammer and javelin. The size of the objects — or implements — that are thrown can vary according to the age level and gender of the competitors. In the discus, the athlete throws a heavy disc using a spinning motion, and in the shot put, the athlete tosses a heavy sphere, usually by pushing it from his or her shoulder. The hammer is actually a heavy ball at the end of a wire with a handle at one end, and it also is thrown using a spinning motion. A javelin is a spear-like implement — youths often use javelins that have been modified to be safer — that is thrown over-handed. [PAR] There also are four field events in which the athletes jump or vault as high or as far as possible: high jump, long jump, triple jump and pole vault. In the high jump and pole vault, the athlete takes a running start and leaps over a bar that is raised after each successful attempt, and he or she lands on a large pad. A pole vaulter uses a long, flexible pole to propel himself or herself over the bar. For the long jump and triple jump, the athlete takes a running start and leaps as far as possible into",Which throwing event does not feature in the Decathlon ?,['hammer'],a8a11d4309c24bfcb7e42291e102888f,"[{'end': [2777, 3102], 'start': [2772, 3097]}]",∃x ThrowingEvent(x) ∧ ¬FeatureInDecathlon(x)

Tensions between the two groups had been rising since the discovery of gold on Native American lands. When a number of tribes missed a federal deadline to move to reservations, the U.S. Army, including Custer and his 7th Calvary, was dispatched to confront them. Custer was unaware of the number of Indians fighting under the command of Sitting Bull (c.1831-90) at Little Bighorn, and his forces were outnumbered and quickly overwhelmed in what became known as Custer’s Last Stand. [PAR] Google [PAR] Battle of the Little Bighorn: Mounting Tensions [PAR] Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse (c.1840-77), leaders of the Sioux on the Great Plains, strongly resisted the mid-19th-century efforts of the U.S. government to confine their people to reservations. In 1875, after gold was discovered in South Dakota’s Black Hills, the U.S. Army ignored previous treaty agreements and invaded the region. This betrayal led many Sioux and Cheyenne tribesmen to leave their reservations and join Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse in Montana . By the late spring of 1876, more than 10,000 Native Americans had gathered in a camp along the Little Bighorn River–which they called the Greasy Grass–in defiance of a U.S. War Department order to return to their reservations or risk being attacked.

Among the Native Americans, word quickly spread of the impending attack. The older Sitting Bull rallied the warriors and saw to the safety of the women and children, while Crazy Horse set off with a large force to meet the attackers head on. Despite Custer’s desperate attempts to regroup his men, they were quickly overwhelmed. Custer and some 200 men in his battalion were attacked by as many as 3,000 Native Americans; within an hour, Custer and all of his soldiers were dead. [PAR] The Battle of the Little Bighorn, also called Custer’s Last Stand, marked the most decisive Native American victory and the worst U.S. Army defeat in the long Plains Indian War.

[PAR] The first modern brassiere to receive a patent was the one invented in 1913 by a New York socialite named Mary Phelps Jacob. Mary Phelps Jacob had just purchased a sheer evening gown for one of her social events. At that time, the only acceptable undergarment was a corset stiffened with whaleback bones. Mary found that the whalebones poked out visible around the plunging neckline and under the sheer fabric. [PAR] Two silk handkerchiefs and some pink ribbon later, Mary had designed an alternative to the corset. The corset's reign was starting to topple. [PAR] An unhealthy and painful device designed to narrow an adult women's waist to 13, 12, 11 and even 10 or less inches, the invention of the corset is attributed to Catherine de Médicis, wife of King Henri II of France.

[PAR] Mary Phelps Jacob's new undergarment complimented the new fashions introduced at the time and demands from friends and family were high for the new brassiere. On November 3, 1914, a U.S. patent for the ""Backless Brassiere"" was issued. [PAR] Caresse Crosby Brassieres [PAR] Caresse Crosby was the business name Mary Phelps Jacob used for her brassiere production. However, running a business was not enjoyable to Jacob and she soon sold the brassiere patent to the Warner Brothers Corset Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut, for $1,500. Warner (the bra-makers, not the movie-makers) made over fifteen million dollars from the bra patent over the next thirty years. [PAR] Mary Phelps Jacob was the first to patent an undergarment named 'Brassiere' derived from the old French word for 'upper arm'. [PAR] Her patent was for a device that was lightweight, soft and separated the breasts naturally. [PAR] Other points in the history of the brassiere worth mentioning: [PAR] In 1875, manufacturers George Frost and George Phelps patented the 'Union Under-Flannel', a no bones, no eyelets, and no laces or pulleys under-outfit.

"[DOC] [TLE] Chemical elementA chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, Z).  There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  [PAR] The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  [PAR] The term ""element"" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms ""elementary substance"" and ""simple substance"" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian простое вещество). One element can form multiple substances different by their structure; they are called allotropes of the element. [PAR] When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds.  Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such ""native elements"" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900. [PAR] The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows (""periods"") in which the columns (""groups"") share recurring (""periodic"") physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most of them in high degrees of purity. [PAR] Description [PAR] The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe  in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass (or 12:1 by number of atoms),   along with tiny traces of",Which element has the chemical symbol S?,"['sulphur', 'sulfur']",76865c1950bf4944a991cbe1d3d96527,"[{'end': [2742, 3321], 'start': [2737, 3316]}]","∃x (ChemicalSymbol(x, ""S""))"

[PAR] And after Mrs. Banks had given the matter some consideration she came to the conclusion that she would rather have Jane, who was the eldest, and Michael, who came next, and John and Barbara, who were Twins and came last of all. So it was settled, and that was how the Banks family came to live at Number Seventeen, with Mrs. Brill to cook for them, and Ellen to lay the tables, and Robertson Ay to cut the lawn and clean the knives and polish the shoes and, as Mr. Banks always said, “to waste his time and my ­money.” [PAR] And, of course, besides these there was Katie Nanna, who doesn’t really deserve to come into the book at all because, at the time I am speaking of, she had just left Number ­Seventeen.

I shall look very ­lopsided.” [PAR] “That,” said Mrs. Banks, “is not of the least importance. You haven’t told me what I’m to do about Katie ­Nanna.” [PAR] “I don’t see how you can do anything about her since she has disappeared,” replied Mr. Banks, “But if it were me—I mean I—well, I should get somebody to put in the Morning Paper the news that Jane and Michael and John and Barbara Banks (to say nothing of their Mother) require the best possible Nannie at the lowest possible wage and at once. Then I should wait and watch for the Nannies to queue up outside the front gate, and I should get very cross with them for holding up the traffic and making it necessary for me to give the policeman a shilling for putting him to so much trouble. Now I must be off. Whew, it’s as cold as the North Pole.

[PAR] Yet, compared to some of the things that exist in our universe, they are absolutely microscopic. Today, we will explore the largest things in the universe based on their relative sizes. [PAR] 11. Largest Asteroid [PAR] Ceres is the largest asteroid we’ve discovered so far. It contains 1/3rd the mass of the entire asteroid belt and is almost 600 miles in diameter. It’s about the size of California and is massive enough that its own gravity forces it into a spherical shape. It’s so large that it also has earned the title of ‘Dwarf Planet’. It’s the only object in the asteroid belt big enough to earn the designation. [PAR] 10. Largest Planet [PAR] Located in the constellation Hercules, planet TRES4 is 70% larger than Jupiter in diameter, but has only 80% of Jupiter’s mass. Because of how close it orbits to its sun, it is thought that the intense heat expand the gasses that make up this planet, resulting in an almost ‘marshmallow-like’ density. It holds the title of the largest planet we’ve discovered so far. [PAR] Update: Science is never finished. Since this list was compiled, observations of an exoplanet called WASP-17b suggest that it is even bigger than TRES4. Despite its radius being twice that of Jupiter’s, it only has half the mass. This makes it even “fluffier” than TRES4. [PAR] 9. Largest Star [PAR] VY Canis Majoris is the largest star (in diameter) that we know of. It’s in a class of star known as Red Hyper Giants. It’s   1,420 times the sun’s radius and would take the world’s fastest race car 2,600 years to circle it once. If you replaced our Sun with VY Canis Majoris, its surface would extend out beyond Saturn. (see picture to the right for comparison to our own sun). [PAR] Update: In 2013, NML Cygni was verified as the largest known star. It’s a whopping 1,650 times our sun’s radius. That is so large; it would take a beam of light 6 hours and 40 minutes to circle it once. [PAR] 2nd Update: Science continues to astound us! Now beating out NML Cygni, UY Scuti is the leading candidate for the largest star ever discovered. At 1,708 times our suns radius, if the earth was the size of a basketball, UY Scuti would be 125,000 feet tall! [PAR] 8. Largest Black Hole [PAR] Black holes are not physically large regions of space. But when you include their mass, they are among the top competitors for the largest things in the universe. And quasar OJ287 is the largest black hole we’ve spotted.< [PAR] It’s estimated to be 18 billion times the mass of our sun and is a supermassive black hole located in the center of a galaxy.

Instead, inspired by Peter Lindbergh's now-iconic portrait of Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz, Christy Turlington, and Cindy Crawford for the January 1990 cover of the British edition of Vogue, Michael asked the five models to appear in the video. While it was not uncommon at the time for models to appear in music videos, usually such models played the love interest of the singer, as with Christie Brinkley's appearance in her then-husband Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" video, or Turlington's appearance in Duran Duran's ""Notorious"" video when she was 17 years old. For ""Freedom '90"", the five models would not portray Michael's on-screen girlfriends, but would lip-synch the song in his place. Evangelista took some persuading before agreeing to appear in the video, saying, ""He thought it would make us into a big deal, that it would be good for us. I was like, 'Please, we're here. We've already arrived!'"" After speaking with Michael, she was convinced, and rearranged her schedule. In a 2015 Vanity Fair article, Evangelista reflected on her decision positively, saying, ""Little did I know that to this day, when someone meets me for the first time, they bring up that video. That's what they remember. So yeah, George was right.""

It's a disgrace to them. Almost like burning all the classics in your fireplace. It almost hurt seeing the plot mushed by the confused writers who have no idea what they are exactly doing. It hurts! [PAR] But the film isn't the worst one ever, and it has a few redeeming qualities, but not the kind that makes you want to see it.

"[DOC] [TLE] Oxford StreetOxford Street is a major road in the City of Westminster in the West End of London. It is Europe's busiest shopping street, with around half a million daily visitors, and as of 2012 had approximately 300 shops. It is designated as part of the A40, a major road between London and Fishguard, though it is not signed as such, and traffic is regularly restricted to buses and taxis. [PAR] The road was originally a Roman road, part of the Via Trinobantina between Essex and Hampshire via London. It was known as Tyburn Road through the Middle Ages and was once notorious as a street where prisoners from Newgate Prison would be transported towards a public hanging. It became known as Oxford Road and then Oxford Street in the 18th century, and began to change character from a residential street to commercial and retail purposes by the late 19th century, also attracting street traders, confidence tricksters and prostitution. The first department stores in Britain opened on Oxford Street in the early 20th century, including Selfridges, John Lewis and HMV. Unlike nearby shopping streets such as Bond Street, it has retained an element of downmarket street trading alongside more prestigious retail stores. The street suffered heavy bombing during World War II, and several longstanding stores including John Lewis were completely destroyed and rebuilt from scratch. [PAR] Despite competition from other shopping centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre, Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location, with several chains hosting their flagship stores on the street, and has a number of listed buildings. The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959. However, the combination of a very popular retail area and a main thoroughfare for London buses and taxis has caused significant problems with traffic congestion, safety and pollution. Various traffic management schemes have been proposed by Transport for London, including a ban on private vehicles during daytime hours on weekdays and Saturdays, and improved pedestrian crossings. [PAR] Location [PAR] Oxford Street runs for approximately . From Marble Arch, where it meets Park Lane, Edgware Road, and its westward continuation Bayswater Road, it runs east past Vere Street, New Bond Street and Bond Street station, up to Oxford Circus, which is the junction with Regent Street. [PAR] Beyond Oxford Circus, it meets Great Portland Street, Wardour Street and Rathbone Place and ends at St Giles Circus, the junction with Charing Cross Road and Tottenham Court Road, next to Tottenham Court Road station. The eastward continuation is New Oxford Street, and then Holborn. The road is entirely within the City of Westminster. [PAR] The street is classified as part of the A40, most of which is a trunk road running from London to Fishguard (via Oxford, Cheltenham, Brecon and Haverfordwest), although like many roads in Central London that are no longer through routes, it is not signposted with the road number. It is within the London Congestion Charging Zone. Numerous bus routes run along Oxford Street, including 10, 25, 55, 73, 98, 390 and Night Buses N8, N55, N73, N98 and N207.  [PAR] History [PAR] Early history [PAR] Oxford Street follows the route of a Roman road, the Via Trinobantina, which linked Calleva Atrebatum (near Silchester, Hampshire) with Camulodunum (now Colchester) via London and became one of the major routes in and out of the city.  [PAR] Between the 12th century and 1782, it was variously known as Tyburn Road (after the River Tyburn that ran just to the south of it, and now flows underneath it), Uxbridge Road (this name is still used for the portion of the London-Oxford road between Shepherds Bush and Uxbridge), Worcester Road and Oxford Road. On Ralph Aggas' ""Plan of London"", published in the 16th century, the road is described partly as ""The Waye to Uxbridge"" followed by ""Oxford Road"", showing rural farmland where the junction of Oxford Street and Rathbone Place now is. [PAR] Despite being a major coaching route, there were several obstacles along it, including the bridge over the Tyburn.

[PAR] In certain parts of the world, like Australia, dermatologists spend much of their time treating conditions resulting from exposure to the sun, such as malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. In other regions, dermatologists are more likely to encounter cosmetic problems; moles, hair and nail disorders, occupational dermatitis, psoriasis, skin infections, eczema, acne, rosacea, and hand dermatitis. Rosacea is a common skin condition that can cause redness and swelling. Hand dermatitis results from contact with household chemical and affects most women with children. The cosmetic problems for which dermatologists can provide assistance include wrinkles, age spots and other signs of aging, hair loss, and scars. Some dermatologists perform minor cosmetic procedures such as face lifts, liposuction, and blepharoplasty, a surgical modification of the eyelid. [PAR] Cosmetics, industrial compounds, and pesticides continually present new dermatological problems. The increased outdoor work and leisure time of people today have increased their exposure to the sun and other hazards that can cause skin problems. It takes years of training and experience to learn how to distinguish the subtle differences in skin problems. Different conditions often share similar symptoms. There is therefore a growing need for more doctors to understand dermatology. [PAR] Family doctors might refer a patient to a dermatologist only after their treatment has failed, or if an unsuccessful treatment has caused complications. Because of this, it is often cost-effective to see a dermatologist in the first instance. Dermatologists are also better able to make an early diagnosis. Dermatology was once considered a ""lightweight"" specialty, but is now recognized as being critical to people's well-being. [PAR] Most skin conditions can be treated with topical therapy such as lotions and creams. The surgical procedures dermatologists must learn include the injection of fillers and botulinum toxin (botox) to give a patient a more youthful appearance at the expense of facial mobility, cryotherapy and other procedures to remove common skin growths such as warts, excision, and skin and nail biopsies where the patient is awake and small amounts of tissue are removed to facilitate diagnosis.

"[DOC] [TLE] Tony HartNorman Antony ""Tony"" Hart (15 October 1925 – 18 January 2009)  was an English artist and children's television presenter. He started off as an officer in a Gurkha regiment but became famous for being a children's presenter and artist on television shows such as Vision On, Playbox, Take Hart and Hartbeat, often accompanied by Morph. He also created the Blue Peter ship logo. [PAR] Early life [PAR] Hart was interested in drawing from an early age. He attended All Saints, Margaret Street Resident Choir School and then Clayesmore School in Dorset, where art was his best subject. [PAR] He left school in 1944 and wanted to join the Royal Air Force, but as he would have been unable to fly owing to slightly deficient eyesight, he instead signed up with the British Indian Army and served as an officer in the 1st Gurkha Rifles. After the war, he was told that low-ranked British officers would be replaced by Indian officers when India became independent and he decided to leave the army. [PAR] After being demobilised, Hart decided to become a professional artist and studied art at Maidstone College of Art, which later became Kent Institute of Art & Design (and is now the Maidstone campus of the University for the Creative Arts). He graduated in 1950 and, after working as a display artist in a London store, became a freelance artist.  The outbreak of the Korean War (25 June 1950) saw him being re-commissioned in the Territorial Army, attached to the Royal Artillery, from 23 November 1948 to 1 July 1950 (?). [PAR] Television career [PAR] Hart's break into broadcast television work came in 1952, after his brother persuaded him to attend a party where he met a BBC children's TV producer. After an interview, in which Hart drew a fish on a napkin while the producer was looking for paper, Hart became resident artist on the Saturday Special programme. Subsequent TV shows included Playbox (1954–59), Tich and Quackers, Vision On (1964–76) Take Hart (1977–83), Hartbeat (1984–93), Artbox Bunch (1995–96) and Smart Hart (1999–2000). From the 1970s, he often appeared alongside the animated Plasticine stop-motion character Morph, created by Peter Lord of Aardman Animations. [PAR] Hart was a regular face on the BBC children's programme Blue Peter in the 1950s and presented a number of programmes in 1959. Richard Marson's book Blue Peter: Inside the Archives lists Hart as a presenter in November 1959 but he is not officially listed as a host. As well as demonstrating small-scale projects (the type that viewers might be able to do), Hart also created large-scale artworks on the TV studio floor, and even used beaches and other open spaces as 'canvases'. [PAR] A regular feature of Hart's TV shows was 'The Gallery', which displayed artworks (paintings, drawings and collages) sent in by young viewers. One of the pieces of easy-listening vibraphone music accompanying this feature—""Left Bank Two"", composed by Wayne Hill and performed by The Noveltones —has passed into British TV theme lore. This was first introduced in the show Vision On. Hart also created the original design for the Blue Peter badge, also used as the programme's logo. He originally asked for his fee to be paid as a royalty of 1d (one pre-decimalisation penny) for each badge made, but was offered a flat fee of £100 (equivalent to around £1,600 at 2006 rates). The badges are famous throughout the UK and have been coveted by three successive generations of Blue Peter viewers. [PAR] Hart received two BAFTA awards. His first, for Best Children's Educational Programme, came in 1984 for Take Hart, and he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. He retired from regular TV work in 2001. [PAR] Personal life [PAR] Hart met his wife, Jean Skingle, while working in television; they married in 1953. They were married for 50 years until she died in 2003.

They met in her father's village which was called Werowocomoco on the north shore of what is now the York River. A tale often associated with Smith and Pocahontas is that she saved him from death by appealing to her father. However, this cannot be proven. In fact, the incident was not recorded until Pocahontas was traveling in London many years later. However, she did help the starving inhabitants of Jamestown during the winter of 1607-1608.

However, little more is known about this relationship. [PAR] The Capture of Pocahontas: [PAR] In 1612, the Powhatan Indians and the English settlers were becoming more hostile with each other. Eight Englishmen had been captured. In retaliation, Captain Samuel Argall captured Pocahontas. It was during this time that Pocahontas met and married John Rolfe who is credited with planting and selling the first tobacco crop in America. [PAR] Lady Rebecca Rolfe: [PAR] It is not known whether Pocahontas actually fell in love with Rolfe before they married. Some conjecture that their marriage was one condition of her release from captivity. Pocahontas converted to Christianity and was baptized Rebecca. She then married Rolfe on April 5, 1614. Powhatan gave his consent and presented Rolfe with a large piece of land. This marriage brought peace between the Powhatans and English until Chief Powhatan's death in 1618. [PAR] Thomas Rolfe Born: [PAR] Pocahontas gave birth to Thomas Rolfe on January 30, 1615. Soon after, she along with her family and her sister Matchanna and her husband traveled to London. She was well received by the English. While in England she met back up with John Smith . [PAR] Illness and Death: [PAR] Rolfe and Pocahontas had decided to return to America in March 1616. However, Pocahontas got sick and soon thereafter died on March 21, 1616. She was only 22 years old. There is not real evidence to the cause of her death. She died in Gravesend, England, but the site of her death was destroyed years later when the church where she was buried was being rebuilt.

[PAR]   Blue Peter and GMTV [PAR] Turner presented the children's television show Blue Peter from 27 June 1992 to 29 June 1994, and around this time, was also associated with publicising ' The Y Plan ', a system of exercise developed by the London YMCA . She moved on to presenting on Totally Live on pan-European music channel Music Box and the ITV morning television station GMTV , which she presented from July 1994 to 24 December 1996. She was also a host on the first National Lottery draw on BBC1 on 19 November 1994 with Noel Edmonds and Gordon Kennedy . She remained as sole host of The National Lottery Live until 20 April 1996, when she defected to ITV and the travel show Wish You Were Here...?, becoming the second highest paid female television presenter in Great Britain, after Cilla Black . She released two work-out videos: Anthea Turner Body Basics (1996) and Anthea Turner: Tone, Lift And Condition: The Inch Buster (1999), both produced and distributed by Grant Bovey . [PAR] The relationship between Turner and her GMTV co-presenter was frosty, with Holmes issuing an ultimatum to the GMTV management that he would leave if they did not sack his colleague; Turner lost her job. [3] After Bovey left his wife Della for Turner, the ensuing tabloid interest, and then the ""Flakegate"" scandal (see below), Turner's career went into a decline. [PAR] Attempting to revive her career, Turner presented BBC1 's short-lived Saturday evening programme Your Kids Are In Charge with her sister in 2000. The following year, she participated in Celebrity Big Brother , and was the third contestant to be evicted, after Chris Eubank and Vanessa Feltz . But nothing seemed to work to erase the fallout from the media reaction to Flakegate , and in 2003 she came 15th in a Channel 4 poll of 100 Worst Britons . [PAR]   Career revival [PAR] In February 2006, Turner made a television comeback on BBC Three in Anthea Turner: Perfect Housewife , where she taught disorganised housewomen and men how to clean and run their houses. The series was accompanied by three related books. Later in 2006, she appeared as a guest on BBC Two 's music-based panel show Never Mind the Buzzcocks . In April 2009 Turner appeared on the ITV reality show Hell's Kitchen with Marco Pierre White, alongside her husband Grant Bovey. Anthea also presented the show Help Me Anthea, I'm Infested for BBC Three, as she advises people whose homes have been overrun by pests. Since then she has appeared on Big Brother serving breakfast in bed to the finalists.

"[DOC] [TLE] Rick Vosper: Who's Number 1? | Bicycle Retailer and ...Rick Vosper: Who's Number 1?  | Bicycle Retailer and Industry News [PAR] Rick Vosper: Who's Number 1? [PAR] Published June 20, 2012 [PAR] by Rick Vosper [PAR] Conventional wisdom is the Big Three bike brands — Trek, Giant, and Specialized — control the lion’s share of the US bike market. Actual numbers in this business are almost impossible to come by, but you’d be hard put to find an industry insider who’d disagree with that statement. [PAR] And in terms of total unit sales, that wisdom is probably right. But when you look a little deeper, from the viewpoint of an individual consumer going into an individual local bike shop, the picture changes pretty significantly. [PAR] Turns out there’s a total of 143 bike brands active in the US market (down from 150 last year). Moreover, in terms of which brands are tops in which shops and/or markets, it’s not Trek, Giant, or Specialized that leads the pack. Not Raleigh or Cannondale or Haro or Diamondback or Schwinn, or any of the top brands we’d all expect. [PAR] On a purely representative basis, the leading brand in the country is…”Other.” And it has been for years. [PAR] The bottom line is that in terms or retail representation, anyway, none of the top ten brands is anywhere near as big as those bottom 130 combined. You’d have to merge Trek and Giant to equal those little guys in aggregate. [PAR] So individually, the smaller brands don’t pack much of a punch, market-impact-wise. But put them all together, and they’re a force to be reckoned with. Which has some very powerful implications for the bike-buying, consumer, for retailers, and for the industry as a whole. More about that in just a minute. [PAR] Source data for this claim is the just-released National Bicycle Dealer Association (NBDA) report,  US Bicycle Market 2011 , written by our friends at the Gluskin-Townley group. You can pick up your own copy for $299 from the NBDA, or save a hundred bucks if you’re a member there. [PAR] The results are based on a survey of more than 300 independent bike shops, and “the basic question,” according to author Jay Townley, “was to write in their bestselling bicycle brands, not numbers, but bestselling brands based on unit volume. So with Trek, for instance, 12% of retailers surveyed said it was their bestselling brand.” [PAR] Even more interesting is how the representation shakes out by shop size, says Townley. “At $300,000 or less, Trek is #7; Redline is #1. At $3000-5000, Trek is #2,Raleighis #1. Where Trek has its hold is in the million-plus-dollar retailers. Trek is not #1 in all regions of the country, nor are they #1 in all size stores. It varies.” [PAR] But wait, there’s more. [PAR] “Trek, Giant, And Specialized pretty much control the top 3 spots,” Townley continues. For the others, it’s very dynamic, depending on a lot of things, including who’s got inventory that year and how good it is in the eyes of the dealers. The only brand which held its position over the past four years is Cannondale at #8. Schwinn held the #11 slot from 2008-2010, then jumped up to the #10 slot in 2011.” [PAR] Makes sense, right? To maximize sales, the most powerful brands make it their business to be in the most powerful (generally = biggest) retailers. But not all bike shops represent all brands, and there’s plenty of excellent not-so-big retailers (and bike brands) in this country…which means there’s a huge number of bike shops representing non-top-10 brands. And neither those retailers nor those brands are going away anytime soon. [PAR] So What’s Your Point?

All the basic topics are covered, including how to impress your sexy new teacher, and what you can do with your mum's vacuum cleaner. [PAR] From Amazon.co.uk [PAR] As the clock strikes midnight and Kevin turns 13 his parents realise to their lasting horror, ""he's losing the power of rational thought; and the use of his arms; he's become a teenager!"". Kevin and best pal Perry are two of the most enduring characters from Harry Enfield's Television Programme, because they embody such familiar stereotypes. Everyone knows a teenager exactly like them, hormones out of control and desperate to break free from hated parental solicitude. Kevin is constantly at war with his parents (""That is so unfair, I hate you!""), and as far as he can see, the whole world is against him. He tries as hard as can to be hip with his friends, pretends to be grown-up and mature, and is constantly dying for a shag--but is of course mortally afraid of the opposite sex. Square parents are ""sick-makingly pathetic"" and pretty much everything is ""unbelievably embarrassing"" in Kevin's world. [PAR] On this tape, the brief Kevin and Perry sketches from the TV show are organised under handy guidelines, such as coping with your friend's parents and tidying your room (""I like it like this, I can find everything when I need it; just because I don't share your stupid bloody middle-class values of tidiness""). Harry Enfield's Kevin is brilliantly supported by Kathy Burke's wonderfully vacant Perry (""alright our Kev, sorted, mad for it"", he opines in a newly acquired Lancastrian accent upon returning from a trip to super-trendy Manchester). The parent--offspring exchanges have an uncanny ring of truth about them, as do the schizophrenic switches from teen-speak to parental address. This is comedy for everyone who either is or was a teenager.

"[DOC] [TLE] The Last of the Mohicans - SparkNotesSparkNotes: The Last of the Mohicans: Themes, Motifs & Symbols [PAR] The Last of the Mohicans [PAR] James Fenimore Cooper [PAR] Themes are the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a literary work. [PAR] Interracial Love and Friendship [PAR] The Last of the Mohicans is a novel about race and the difficulty of overcoming racial divides. Cooper suggests that interracial mingling is both desirable and dangerous. Cooper lauds the genuine and longtime friendship between Hawkeye, a white man, and Chingachgook, a Mohican Indian. Hawkeye and Chingachgook’s shared communion with nature transcends race, enabling them to team up against Huron enemies and to save white military leaders like Heyward. On the other hand, though, Cooper shows his conviction that interracial romances are doomed and undesirable. The interracial love of Uncas and Cora ends in tragedy, and the forced interracial relationship between Cora and Magua is portrayed as unnatural. Through Cora, Cooper suggests that interracial desire can be inherited; Cora desires Indian men because her mother was part black. [PAR] Literal and Metaphorical Nature [PAR] Nature functions both literally and metaphorically in The Last of the Mohicans. In its literal form, nature is the physical frontier that surrounds the characters and complicates their battles and their chances for survival. In the opening paragraphs of Chapter I, Cooper describes the unpredictability of the colonial terrain, pointing out that the cleared, flat battlefields of Europe are no longer the setting for war. The New World has a new set of natural difficulties, and the men at war must contend not just with each other but with the unfriendly land. The forbidding landscape seems even more daunting to the English because their adversaries, the Indians loyal to France, know the land so well. The skills of the English have no place in the forests of America. David Gamut’s religious Calvinism, a European religion, becomes ridiculous in the wilderness. [PAR] Metaphorically, the land serves as a blank canvas on which the characters paint themselves. Cooper defines characters by their relationships to nature. Hawkeye establishes his claim to heroism by respecting the landscape. The English Major Heyward establishes his incompetence by misunderstanding the landscape. While he means well, his unfamiliarity with the wilderness thwarts him. Magua uses the landscape to carry out his villainy, hiding women in caves, jumping wildly over abysses, and hiding behind rocks. [PAR] The Role of Religion in the Wilderness [PAR] The character David Gamut allows Cooper to explore the relevance of religion in the wilderness. In theory at least, the American frontier is untouched by human culture. It is a fresh start, a piece of land not ruled by the conventions of European high culture, a place without a firm government or social code. Gamut’s aggressive Calvinism symbolizes the entrance of religion, a European model that enters the blank slate of the New World. We know Gamut is a Calvinist because he talks about predestination, the idea that God has a plan for each person and no amount of human effort can change that plan. Hawkeye’s frequent mockery of Gamut’s psalmody provides the novel’s comic relief. The mockery, which comes from the mouth of the hero, also suggests that institutional religion should not attempt to penetrate the wilderness and convert its inhabitants. Because Cooper makes Gamut ridiculous and Hawkeye heroic, it seems that, like Hawkeye, Cooper scoffs at Calvinism’s tenets. [PAR] Gamut’s fatalism contrasts with Hawkeye’s pragmatism. Hawkeye adapts to his surroundings and helps the other characters to achieve improbable survivals, all of which suggests that Cooper believes humans do have the ability to determine their own fates. By the end of the novel the Calvinist Gamut learns to move beyond the rigidity of his religion and become a helpful and committed ally. He succeeds when he finds the ability to leave behind his fatalistic passivity and adapt to the demands of the forest. Cooper’s exploration of Calvinism sets the stage for many American writers of subsequent generations. For example, Herman Melville’s tragic hero Ahab subscribes to the rigid belief in fate that Calvinism endorses. [PAR] The Changing Idea of Family [PAR] Cooper uses the frontier setting to explore the changing status of the family unit. Cooper posits that the wilderness demands new definitions of family.

"[DOC] [TLE] How to save a dying heart | PBS NewsHourHow to save a dying heart | PBS NewsHour [PAR] How to save a dying heart [PAR] EMAIL [PAR] BY Dr. Howard Markel   December 3, 2013 at 11:50 AM EST [PAR] In a monthly column for PBS NewsHour, Dr. Howard Markel revisits moments that changed the course of modern health and medicine on their anniversaries, like the world’s first human heart transplant on Dec. 3, 1967. In the photo above, Amy DeStefano of Portsmouth, N.H., recovers after a transplant in 2012. Photo by Wendy Maeda/The Boston Globe [PAR] Dec. 3, 1967 is a red-letter day in the history of medicine. It was also an important date in the personal history of Dr. Christiaan Barnard. [PAR] The South African surgeon made international headlines by successfully removing the dying heart of a 54-year-old grocer named Louis Washkansky and replacing it with a healthy heart. [PAR] Dr. Christiaan Barnard in 1969. Photo by YOU magazine/Gallo Images [PAR] The donor, a 25-year-old woman named Denise Darvall, was in a car accident the day before. While still technically alive, Darvall was diagnosed by her physicians as “brain-dead.” The operation, at Cape Town’s Groote Schuur Hospital, lasted nine hours and required a team of 30 people, including Dr. Barnard’s brother Marius, who was also a surgeon. [PAR] Louis Washkansky emigrated from Lithuania to South Africa in 1922 and built a thriving grocery business in Cape Town. A decorated World War II veteran who saw action in Africa and Italy, Louis was once an avid athlete who excelled in swimming, football and weightlifting. [PAR] Unfortunately, Washkansky was also a diabetic who developed a progressive and incurable form of congestive heart failure. Unresponsive to medications and rest, Washkansky’s cardiologist referred him to Dr. Barnard, who had been hard at work experimenting with heart transplants in animals. [PAR] Although the kidney transplant was still a relatively new but successful procedure, having been developed in the early 1950s, heart transplantation was a far more difficult problem both in terms of surgical procedure and in effectively turning off a patient’s immune system to prevent the rejection of another person’s heart. There was also the issue of finding suitable organ donors — a concept now well-known and acceptable to most people, was once a disturbing, ethical dilemma. [PAR] Dr. Barnard was hardly the only surgeon interested in heart transplantation during this period. He had active competition from Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz and his surgical team at Brooklyn’s Maimonides Medical Center, where the world’s second (and the United States’ first) heart transplant was performed on Dec. 6, 1967. Two other surgeons who performed the controversial procedure soon after Barnard were Drs. Norman Shumway of Stanford University, on Jan. 6, 1968, and Richard Lower of the Medical College of Virginia in May of 1968. [PAR] As Dr. Barnard later wrote in his memoir, “One Life,” it was relatively easy to convince Louis Washkansky to undergo the novel operation: “For a dying man, it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side.” [PAR] Dr. Barnard in the operating room. Photo by Popperfoto/Getty Images. [PAR] Getting a suitable heart to replace Washkansky’s damaged one was a bit more difficult. Brain death was a controversial diagnosis back in 1967 and several judges around the globe threatened to arrest and jail surgeons who took organs from such afflicted individuals. Nevertheless, Dr. Barnard secured permission from Denise Darvall’s father and commenced with the operation. [PAR] Recalling these historic moments years later, Dr. Barnard explained, “as soon as the donor died, we opened her chest and connected her to a heart-lung machine, suffusing her body so that we could keep the heart alive. I cut out the heart. We examined it, and as soon as we found it was normal, we put it in a dish containing solution at 10 degrees Centigrade to cool it down further. We then transferred this heart to the operating","In 1967, Louis Washkansky became the first person to receive what?",['human heart transplant'],de7e7056903c4dc29f3b4905afdf0c17,"[{'end': [400], 'start': [379]}]","∃x ReceivedFirst(x, LouisWashkansky, 1967)"

Lee Westwood has won in both the European Tour and the PGA tour and was named player of the year in 1998, 2000, and 2009.  Lee Westwood began playing golf late for someone who turned pro and has such a dominant and successful career.  He began playing when he was 13 with half a golf set given to him by his grandparents. Less than two years later, Lee Westwood was the junior champion of Nottinghamshire and by 1993, he won the British Youth Championship and turned pro.

It might also be flavored with a number of vegetables. Focaccia can be used as a side to many meals, as a base for pizza, or as sandwich bread. Focaccia al rosmarino (focaccia with rosemary) is a common focaccia style in Italian cuisine that may be served as an antipasto, appetizer, table bread, or snack. [PAR] Composition  [PAR] The common-known focaccia is salt focaccia. Focaccia doughs are similar in style and texture to pizza doughs, consisting of high-gluten flour, oil, water, salt and yeast. It is typically rolled out or pressed by hand into a thick layer of dough and then baked in a stone-bottom or hearth oven. Bakers often puncture the bread with a knife to relieve bubbling on the surface of the bread. [PAR] Also common is the practice of dotting the bread. This creates multiple wells in the bread by using a finger or the handle of a utensil to poke the unbaked dough. As a way to preserve moisture in the bread, olive oil is then spread over the dough, by hand or with a pastry brush prior to rising and baking. In the northern part of Italy, lard will sometimes be added to the dough, giving the focaccia a softer, slightly flakier texture. Focaccia recipes are widely available, and with the popularity of bread machines, many cookbooks now provide versions of dough recipes that do not require hand kneading. [PAR] Comparison with pizza  [PAR] The primary difference between conventional pizza (round, Neapolitan pizza) and focaccia is that pizza dough uses very little leavening (baker’s yeast), resulting in a very thin, flat and flexible crust, while focaccia dough uses more leavening, causing the dough to rise significantly higher. The added leavening firms the crust and gives focaccia the capacity to absorb large amounts of olive oil. Unleavened pizza dough is already too dense to absorb much olive oil. A conventional loaf of bread is too tall to absorb olive oil all the way through to its center. Being shorter in height than a conventional loaf and less dense than a pizza dough, focaccia can indeed absorb olive oil all the way to its center or at least nearly so. As such, focaccia might well be thought of as ""olive oil bread"". [PAR] Focaccia is most often square whereas conventional pizza is more commonly round. Focaccia most often employs more salt than pizza. [PAR] There exist traditional Italian pizza recipes, incorporating more leavening, in amounts similar to focaccia, especially in southern Italy, and specifically sfinciuni (Sicilian pizza). If these leavened pizzas were to incorporate equivalent amounts of olive oil in the dough, they would be very similar to a focaccia, except perhaps for the herbs or toppings used. Similarly any ""thick-crust"" pizza that incorporates large amounts of olive oil would be very similar to focaccia, again except for the variance in the herbs and toppings employed. [PAR] Contrary to pizza where more than one topping is often found mixed on the same pizza, toppings are not commonly mixed on one focaccia although one topping and one herb might be mixed. Whereas pizza often has toppings peppered only intermittently on its surface, on focaccia, a single topping is often layered more uniformly and thick. [PAR] Etymology and regional variants  [PAR] In Ancient Rome, panis focacius was a flat bread baked on the hearth.  The word is derived from the Latin focus meaning ""hearth, place for baking.""   The basic recipe is thought by some to have originated with the Etruscans or ancient Greeks, but today it is widely associated with Ligurian cuisine.  [PAR] As the tradition spread, the different dialects and diverse local ingredients resulted in a large variety of bread (some may even be considered cake). Due to the number of small towns and hamlets dotting the coast of Liguria, the focaccia recipe has fragmented into countless",What type of food is focaccia?,['italian bread'],ff02fd242d3848d69caf2791ab122b68,"[{'end': [62], 'start': [50]}]","∃x (TypeOfFood(x) ∧ Name(x, ""focaccia""))"

[PAR] WITH the passing of London-born Millvina Dean at the age of 97, the world has lost the last living link with the 1912 Titanic disaster in which more than 1,500 people perished, including her father. At ten weeks old, she was the youngest person on the ship when it hit an iceberg on 14 April, 1912, and, until her death, she was the last survivor of the 706 who escaped.

[PAR] Elizabeth Gladys Dean – the nickname Millvina came later and stuck – was born in London on 2 February, 1912, to a pub landlord, Bertram Dean, who was determined to seek his a new life in the Land of the Free by opening a tobacconist's in Wichita, Kansas. When she was nine and a half weeks old, her father, her 32-year-old mother Georgette (""Ettie"") and her brother Bertram jnr, who was nearly two, boarded the much-heralded liner at its home port of Southampton. [PAR] Her father had paid 20, 11 shillings and sixpence for a third-class ticket for the whole family. They were meant to board a different White Star liner until a coal strike forced them to switch. [PAR] For those passengers in first and second class, the mighty, four-funnelled White Star ocean liner had everything, including a swimming pool, a luxurious dining room and a mahogany-panelled smoking room, but it would soon emerge that it lacked something far more important – enough lifeboats for the more than 2,200 souls on board. [PAR] Dean was too young to remember the events of 14-15 April and her mother never even told her she had been on the vessel, or that her father had died on it, until she was eight. However,  she came to learn  that, at 11.40pm on the night of the 14th, her father heard a scraping noise, woke the children, dressed them warmly and headed for the upper decks.

A kitchen mandoline is basically  a food slicer or a hand-powered food processor and is a relatively versatile  tool that can add to the ease of preparation of any meal while creating  beautiful edible presentations with minimal effort. [PAR] When using a kitchen mandoline, the best thing to do is to  first read the manufacturer’s directions.  Most slicers work in a similar fashion, but the directions related to  the particular kitchen mandoline you are using will give you all the  information you need to know in order to set it up, adjust the thickness  levels, change and add blades and properly clean the utensil. [PAR] Once the kitchen mandoline is set up, you can set the  thickness level based on the type of cut you require. You may need to test the cuts by using a  piece of food and cutting it a few times with the platform set at different  heights so you can choose the thickness that is best. After the platforms are set, the food to be  cut should be laid on the platform of the kitchen mandoline and should be  attached to the holding device that comes with the slicer. The holding device is a necessity in order to  prevent injury from your hand or fingers coming into contact with the sharp  blade. In order to safely use a kitchen  mandoline, it is important to always use the holder to move the food across the  slicer, rather than your hand. Most  holders have prongs that attach to the food so that as you move the holder  across the slicing platform, the food will be moved along with the holder in a  secure fashion. Wearing a cut resistant glove while slicing is also a good idea. [PAR] A kitchen mandoline operates by pushing the food along the  platform until it comes in contact with the blade. Once the food hits the blade, it cuts a slice  off of the whole part of the food that is the thickness of the space between  the platform where the food resides and the platform where the blade  resides. The kitchen mandoline creates  perfectly uniform slices because each time the food is moved across the  platform and comes in contact with the blade it is the same distance apart and  therefore makes slices of the same thickness. [PAR] Once the food is sliced by the blade of the kitchen  mandoline, it drops down onto a plate, bowl, or other vessel that is set up  below the slicer. After each slice is  made, the food is moved back up across the platform and then back down again  across the blade to create the next cut.  This process is repeated for as many slices as are necessary. [PAR] If more decorative cuts or julienne slices are desired, the  blades of the kitchen mandoline need to be changed, but the process of cutting  the food remains the same. The blades of  the kitchen mandoline do all of the work for you. This is a lot easier than trying to steady a  piece of food on a cutting surface and cutting through it with a knife in the  hopes that the slices are close to the same size and look fairly decent.

The couscous grains are then prepared by steaming them until they have a light, fluffy consistency. [PAR] (Scroll down to see some easy couscous recipes.) [PAR] Couscous is closely related to pasta, as durum wheat , ground into semolina flour , is the same type of wheat that is most commonly used for making pasta. [PAR] Couscous originated in North Africa, where it is traditionally prepared as part of a meat or vegetable stew seasoned with cumin . Today, couscous is found in many cuisines, including much of the Middle East and various Mediterranean cuisines, as well as the United States and western European countries such as France and the U.K. [PAR] Israeli couscous is a variation on the traditional couscous which is made of larger, smoother, spherical granules. Israeli couscous has a slightly chewier texture than regular couscous. [PAR] Cooking Couscous: The traditional technique for preparing couscous involves steaming the granules multiple times in a tall pot called a couscousière. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Cranberry Almond Couscous [PAR] Most commercially available couscous is an instant form which has been steamed and then dried. [PAR] Preparing instant couscous is quick and easy — the dried couscous is added to a pot of boiling water or stock, the pot is then covered and the water is absorbed into the couscous in about five minutes. [PAR] Couscous Recipes: There are any number of couscous recipes that are essentially variations on this technique, and they can be savory or slightly sweet, depending on the ingredients that are added. It can be prepared with lemon, toasted almonds, peas, raisins or currants, even apples or apricots. Couscous is frequently used in salads. See the links below for some easy couscous recipes. [PAR] Common Misspelling: Cous cous[DOC] [TLE] Did You Know: Food History - What is Couscous and HowReturn to topics » [PAR] Couscous is one of the staple foods of the Maghrib (western North  Africa). Couscous is made from two different sizes of the husked and crushed, but unground, semolina of hard wheat using water to bind them. Semolina is the hard part of the grain of hard wheat (Triticum turgidum var. durum), that resisted the grinding of the relatively primitive medieval millstone. When hard wheat is ground, the endosperm�the floury part of the grain�is cracked into its two parts, the surrounding aleurone with its proteins and mineral salts and the central floury mass, also called the endosperm, which contains the gluten protein that gives hard wheat its unique properties for making couscous and pasta--that is, pasta secca or dried pasta, also called generically macaroni. Couscous is also the name for all of the prepared dishes made from hard wheat or other grains such as barley, millet, sorghum, rice, or maize. [PAR] Although the word couscous might derive from the Arabic word kaskasa, ""to pound small,"" it is generally thought to derive from one of the Berber dialects because it does not take the article indicating a foreign language origin. It has also been suggested that the word derives from the Arabic name for the perforated earthenware steamer pot used to steam the couscous, called a kiskis (the French translation couscousi�re is the word English-speaking writers have adopted), while another theory attributes the word couscous to the onomatopoeic--the sound of the steam rising in the couscousi�re, the most unlikely explanation. [PAR] Preparing Couscous [PAR] The key to preparing an authentic couscous is patience and care. Experience will prove the best guide, but these instructions are meant to cut that time down for the novice. There are two basic steps in preparing couscous before the cooking process: forming the couscous and humidifying and drying the couscous. The first of these steps, forming the couscous--that is, preparing couscous from ""scratch""--is rarely done anymore, even by Moroccans, Algerians, and Tunisians. Only poorer folk, some rural populations, and Berber tribes still make couscous from scratch.

Faith, that is, in science and technology as saviours, makers of a new heaven and a new earth coming down from outer space. The later years of the decade marked a turning point, as scientific progress ceased to be an unquestioned good, as the environmental and social costs of modernity became a cause for concern. The turn of the tide was visible early in seemingly superficial things. Modernist styles in fashion and design were supplemented or replaced by historical revivals. Musical culture concentrated ever more on sensual, irrational experience. Design guru Paul Reilly, writing in 1966, sensed that television and magazines had undermined modernity, as people saw the historical and the modern side by side as equals to be chosen or mixed, rather than as a linear progression with the modern superseding the historical. The stylistic and behavioural revolutions of the 60s were the firstfruits of an enduring cultural change. Somewhere between 1965 and 1968, Western society crossed the boundary from modern to postmodern. [PAR] People now in their 60s and 70s were in their 30s during the 1960s. Some embraced the new culture. Some saw themselves as already too old. And many followed the changes up to a point where the aesthetic and cultural break with their own formative years was too great, and stopped there. The sea-change in sentiment can be symbolised by the failure of the Beatles' single 'Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane', the firstfruits of the 'Sergeant Pepper' sessions, to reach number 1 in February 1967 - their first single to miss number 1 since 'Love Me Do'. The song that outsold it, 'Release Me' by Engelbert Humperdinck, illustrates the desire of a significant - generally older - part of the pop audience for a more straightforward and comforting music. [PAR] This has been noted by several writers on the period, because it contradicts the myth of 1967 as belonging to the counterculture. In the year of Jimi Hendrix and the Monterey pop festival, 'Sergeant Pepper' and the Summer of Love, the three best-selling singles were all by Humperdinck.

[PAR] Drax Power Station, United Kingdom [PAR] Labelled as the largest, cleanest and most efficient coal-fired power station in the UK, the 4,000MW Drax plant supplies 7% of the country's electricity needs. Drax is located in Selby, Yorkshire (UK), and owned by Drax Power (the operating subsidiary of Drax Group). [PAR] In 2008, Drax Power began an £100m co-firing upgrade project that reduces the company's CO2 usage by one million tonnes a year. The existing co-firing facility of the plant provides 500MW of renewable electricity by operating alongside the new 400MW facility. [PAR] The upgrade project was completed in June 2012 and increased the plant's efficiency by 40%. [PAR] Siemens won a multimillion order from Drax Power in March 2013 for the supply and installation of three intermediate pressure (IP) steam turbine modules at the station. The IP modules were produced at Siemens' factory located at Mülheim an der Ruhr in Germany. [PAR] Each IP module weighs 63.5t and has 26 rows of blades. The first module was installed in 2014, and the installation was completed in 2015. [PAR] Reduced emissions [PAR] Emissions from the plant are controlled. The generators are fitted with flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment that removes 90% of sulphur dioxide (SO2) from emissions. Drax also uses retrofitting boosted over fire air (BOFA) technology for its boilers to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOX). [PAR] ""The 4,000MW Drax plant supplies around 7% of the UK's electricity needs."" [PAR] By-products of the coal combustion and FGD processes are recycled for the construction industry. Any ash from the combustion process that is not sold is deposited in an ash disposal site. Previously derelict land, the disposal site has been reclaimed and restored for agricultural use and woodland planting. [PAR] Clyde Bergemann Doncaster (CBD) installed its turnkey solution at the Drax Power station, as part of a contract signed in January 2014, to separate biomass ash storage silo in the vicinity of the current storage bunkers to receive and store ash from current pneumatic ash systems. [PAR] Drax employs 560 people and supports many other local jobs indirectly. It is also a major customer for the UK's remaining coalmines. [PAR] Six generators [PAR] Coal is transported to the station by 1,000t coal trains, with shuttle conveyors distributing the coal between the bunkers. These store the coal before it goes to the pulverising mills. These crush the coal into a fine powder using ten large metal balls. [PAR] Each boiler has two forced draught fans that draw warm air from the top of the boiler house through large air heaters. The 'primary' air used to blow the coal from the mill to the boiler is supplied by fan. [PAR] Each of the six turbines consists of five separate turbines, namely one high pressure (HP), one intermediate-pressure (IP) and three low-pressure (LP). [PAR] To produce steam Drax has six boilers, each weighing 4,000t. They convert energy from coal into steam at a rate of 563kg/s (4,468,243lb/h). Pure boiler feedwater is turned to steam inside 480km of steel tubing by the heat of the boiler or furnace. [PAR] The steam temperature is raised to 568°C and the pressure to 166bar (2,400lb/in²).

They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division. They are also the third-oldest franchise in the NFL,  organized and starting play in 1919.  It is the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States. Home games are played at Lambeau Field. [PAR] The Packers are the last vestige of ""small town teams"" common in the NFL during the 1920s and '30s. Founded in 1919 by Earl ""Curly"" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest. They joined the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921. Although Green Bay is by far the smallest professional sports market in North America, its local fan and media base extends 120 miles south into Milwaukee, where it played selected home games between 1933 and 1994. [PAR] The Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine NFL titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowl victories. They won the first two Super Bowls in 1967 and 1968 and were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) before to the AFL–NFL merger. The Vince Lombardi Trophy is named after the Packers head coach of the same name, who guided them to their first two Super Bowls. Their two further Super Bowl wins came in 1997 and 2011.[http://www.packers.com/history/super-bowls-and-championships.html Super Bowls & Championships] from Packers.com. Obtained November 7, 2011. [PAR] The Packers are long-standing adversaries of the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions, who together comprise the NFL's NFC North division. The Bears–Packers rivalry is one of the oldest in NFL history, dating back to 1921. [PAR] Founding [PAR] The Green Bay Packers were founded on August 11, 1919  by former high-school football rivals Earl ""Curly"" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun.  Lambeau solicited funds for uniforms from his employer, the Indian Packing Company. He was given $500 ($ today) for uniforms and equipment, on the condition that the team be named for its sponsor. The Green Bay Packers have played in their original city longer than any other team in the NFL. [PAR] On August 27, 1921, the Packers were granted a franchise in the new national pro football league that had been formed the previous year. Financial troubles plagued the team and the franchise was forfeited within the year, before Lambeau found new financial backers and regained the franchise the next year. These backers, known as the ""Hungry Five"", formed the Green Bay Football Corporation. [PAR] Notable seasons [PAR] 1929–1931: Lambeau's team arrives [PAR] After a near-miss in 1927, Lambeau's squad claimed the Packers' first NFL title in 1929 with an undefeated 12–0–1 campaign, behind a stifling defense which registered eight shutouts.  Green Bay would repeat as league champions in 1930 and 1931, bettering teams from New York, Chicago and throughout the league, with all-time greats and future Hall of Famers Mike Michalske, Johnny (Blood) McNally, Cal Hubbard and Green Bay native Arnie Herber.

"[DOC] [TLE] Fennel - The EpicentreThe EpicentreFennel - The Epicentre [PAR] Fennel [PAR] Fennel [PAR] What is Fennel? [PAR] Fennel yields both a herb and a spice. All plant parts are edible: roots, stalks and leaves, with the spice coming from the dried seeds. A native to the Mediterranean, it is an ancient and common plant known to the ancient Greeks and spread throughout Europe by Imperial Rome. It is also grown in India, the Orient, Australia, South America and has become naturalized in the US. It has been called the “meeting’ seed” by the Puritans who would chew it during their long church services. The name derives from the Latin foeniculum, meaning “little hay”. [PAR] Spice Description [PAR] Fennel seeds split into two, one sometimes remaining on the stalk. They are 4 -8 mm (1/8 – 5/16 in) long, thin and curved, with colour varying from brown to light green (the green being superior). [PAR] Bouquet: warm, sweet and aromatic [PAR] Flavour: similar to a mild anise [PAR] Hotness Scale: 1 [PAR] Cooking with Fennel [PAR] As a herb, fennel leaves are used in French and Italian cuisine’s in sauces for fish and in mayonnaise. In Italy fennel is also used to season pork roasts and spicy sausages, especially the Florentine salami finocchiona. It is traditionally considered one of the best herbs for fish dishes. [PAR] The English use the seeds in almost all fish dishes, especially as a court bouillon for poaching fish and seafood. It is used to flavor breads, cakes and confectionery. It is an ingredient of Chinese Five Spices and of some curry powders. Several liquors are flavoured with fennel, including fennouillette, akvavit, gin and was used in distilling absinthe . [PAR] Preparation and Storage [PAR] Seeds can be used whole or ground in a spice mill or mortar and pestle. Store away from light in airtight containers. [PAR] Fennel Substitute [PAR] Fennel bulb substitute: When cooked, fennel is sweet and soft. Onions also become sweet like fennel does when it is cooked and can be used to substitute fennel that is sautéed or grilled. If a recipe calls for raw fennel for a salad,though, celery is much closer in texture to fennel. Fennel is crunchy and firm when raw, like celery, but celery is not as sweet. [PAR] Fennel leaf substitute: The flavor of dill is more grassy and savory than the flavor of fennel fronds, but still make a suitable replacement. For a fresher and brighter-flavored herb, you can use cilantro or parsley . [PAR] Fennel seed substitute: The closest substitution for fennel seeds are anise seeds, which come from a different plant but also have a licorice flavor. [PAR] Health Benefits of Fennel [PAR] In the first century, Pliny noted that after snakes had shed their skins, they ate fennel to restore their sight. It has since been used as a wash for eyestrain and irritations. Chinese and Hindus used it as a snake bite remedy. It is carminative, a weak diuretic and mild stimulant. The oil is added to purgative medication to prevent intestinal colic. [PAR] Fennel was once used to stimulate lactation. It allays hunger and was thought to be a cure for obesity in Renaissance Europe. It should not be used in high dosages as it causes muscular spasms and hallucinations. The major constituents of fennel, which include the terpenoid anethole, are found in the volatile oil. Anethole and other terpenoids inhibit spasms in smooth muscles, such as those in the intestinal tract, and this is thought to contribute to fennel’s use as a carminative (gas-relieving and gastrointestinal tract cramp-relieving agent). [PAR] Related compounds to anethole may have mild estrogenic actions, although this has not been proven in humans. It is also thought to possess diuretic (increase in urine production), choleretic (increase in production of bile), pain-reducing, fever-reducing, and anti-microbial actions. [PAR] The seeds are used as a flavoring agent in many herbal medicines, and to help disperse flatulence. The seeds, and roots, also help to open obstructions of the liver, spleen & gall bladder, and to ease painful swellings, in addition",What is the predominant flavour of fennel?,['anise'],1022f7ad74dd49e99befb7eeb49f0033,"[{'end': [981, 2544], 'start': [977, 2540]}]","∃x (Flavor(x, Fennel) ∧ Predominant(x))"
"[DOC] [TLE] Grape Leaves Stuffed with Rice and Ground Beef (Mahshi ...Grape Leaves Stuffed with Rice and Ground Beef (Mahshi Wara’ Enab) | mideats.com [PAR] Grape Leaves Stuffed with Rice and Ground Beef (Mahshi Wara’ Enab) [PAR] October 2, 2011 Heba Appetizer , Beef , Grape Leaves , Spotlight 29 [PAR] Whenever I tell anyone that I’m originally from Egypt and that I love to cook, the first question is usually: “Do you ever make stuffed grape/vine leaves (wara’  enab in Arabic)?” I smile; how could I not have made this old-time favorite? It’s almost in every Mediterranean culture to know the craft of making this gourmet masterpiece from the simple scraps – loose vine leaves, rice, and ground bits of meat. And a masterpiece it is — it’s one of my favorite meals of all time! Even my grandparents listed it as one of their favorite meals. Egyptians have likely borrowed the idea of stuffing grape vine leaves from their Greek or Turkish neighbors who have purportedly been rolling for centuries. [PAR] A 1983 NY Times article  devoted to the history of grape leaves gives most credit to the Greeks for this culinary feat: “Greeks will tell you that the origin of stuffed vine leaves goes back to the time when Alexander the Great besieged Thebes. Food became so scarce that the Thebans cut what meat they had into little bits and rolled it in grape leaves.” Nice! I like stories of people who learn to utilize what’s available in the most creative way possible. The article goes on to say that “later, it has been suggested, the Byzantines refined and spiced the preparation and filled not only grape leaves but leaves of other vines as well as the leaves from hazelnut, mulberry and fig trees.” Now I’m really intrigued — I grew up eating Greek dolmades, or grape leaves, but I’ve never heard of anyone stuffing hazelnut or fig leaves. In fact, I have no idea what those look like, but I’m intrigued enough to look into it. I’ll let you know when I do. [PAR] A kind commenter on this post pointed out to me that other sources suggest that the Turks were responsible for ‘inventing the dolma’. According to this article on The Huffington Post Encyclopedia : “The Ottoman origin is somewhat obscured by the fact that in some countries stuffed vegetables may be referred to by a native name meaning ‘stuffed’, such as yemistos (Greek) or mahshi (Arabic). Indeed, some Arabic dialects rarely if ever use the word ‘dolma’. Nevertheless, the signs of Turkish origin are clear. In places as remote as Kuwait and Damascus, instead of mahshi waraq inab (stuffed vine leaf) one may say mahshi yabraq (in Kuwait, mahshi brag), which comes from the Turkish yaprak (leaf).” Well, this article is right in saying we never call stuffed grape leaves ‘dolma’ in the Middle East; and in Egypt, I’ve never heard it referred to as ‘yabraq’.

Belgium shares much of its history with the Netherlands and the other Low Countries, including the migration of the Celtics. In Belgium, there were people known as the Belgae on the northern edge of Gaul. [PAR] Though influenced by the Celts, Belgae had a different language and Germanic origins. The Romans, led by Julius Caesar, arrived in the region, making an alliance and turning part of it into a Roman province called Gallia Belgica along with parts of modern-day France and Germany. Other parts of modern-day Belgium were included in Germania Inferior and Belgica Prima. At the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the region saw the rise of the Franks, with the Merovingian Dynasty, followed by the Carolingian Dynasty. In 843, the region was divided into Middle Francia and West Francia by the Treaty of Verdun, and ruled by the Holy Roman Empire. [PAR] Independent fiefdoms emerged from these divisions, and by 1433, the region of the Low Countries came to be ruled by the Duchy of Burgundy. Then by marriage, it came under the ruleof the Habsburgs and then joined to Spain under Charles V, who was the Roman Emperor. In 1549, under the Pragmatic Sanction, the Seventeen Provinces were formed in modern-day Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and parts of France. The region was divided in the Eighty Years' War from 1568 to 1648, and Belgium was separated into the Southern Netherlands. The area was annexed by France during the French Revolution and at its dissolution, becoming the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. A rebel movement erupted with the Belgian Revolution in 1830, and the Southern Provinces separated from the Netherlands, becoming Belgium with King Leopold I as its leader in 1831. [PAR] With the German Schlieffen Plan, Belgium was a major battleground in what became known as the Rape of Belgium, but at the end of World War I, Belgium annexed parts of Prussia to expand its territory. However, by 1940, Germany invaded Belgium once again and the king was eventually forced to abdicate. The territory was returned after the war, and the Belgium became a founding member of NATO and is united with the Netherlands and Luxembourg as the Benelux group. [PAR] Neighboring Countries of Belgium [PAR] Belgium is bordered by the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and France. [PAR] Major Cities [PAR] Ypres [PAR] Geography [PAR] Belgium is situated in the lowlands of Western Europe, with coastline along the North Sea. The terrain of Belgium is divided into three regions, including the northern coastal plains and sand dunes, the rocky hills and forests of Ardennes in the south, and the plateau between the two, which features fertile valleys and gorges. The coastal regions of Belgium are protected by dikes and much of the land is reclaimed and is situated below sea level, leaving them prone to flooding. [PAR] The highest point in Belgium is located at Signal de Botrange, at an elevation of 694 meters (2,277 feet) above sea level. The main rivers of Belgium include the Scheldt, the Meuse, and the Yser Rivers, and canals are common in the coastal region of the country, including the Brussels-Scheldt and Brussels-Charleroi Canals. [PAR] Points of Interest [PAR] Though a fairly small country, Belgium is packed with historical sites and architecture, with a vibrant culture and natural sites, too. The capital, Brussels, is a multicultural city with international flair, with both Flemish and Dutch populations. Notable sites in the capital include the Grand Palace-Grote Markt in the town center, with historic buildings and Belgian waffle shops, Manneken Pis, the city's iconic statue, and a variety of museums, parks, cathedrals, and squares. Brussels also houses meeting spaces of the European Union.

[PAR] Several groups of elements can be termed metals. Here is look at the location of the metals on the periodic table and their common properties: [PAR] Examples of Metals [PAR] Most of the elements on the periodic table are metals, including gold, silver, platinum, mercury, uranium, aluminum, sodium and calcium. Alloys, such as brass and bronze, also are metals. [PAR] Location of Metals on the Periodic Table [PAR] Metals are located on the left side and the middle of the periodic table . Group IA and Group IIA (the alkali metals ) are the most active metals. The transition elements , groups IB to VIIIB, are also considered metals. The basic metals are the element to the right of the transition metals. The bottom two rows of elements beneath the body of the periodic table are the lanthanides and actinides , which are also metals. [PAR] Properties of Metals [PAR] Metals are shiny solids are room temperature (except mercury, which is a shiny liquid element ), with characteristic high melting points and densities. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Trends in the Periodic Table [PAR] Many of the properties of metals, including large atomic radius, low ionization energy , and low electronegativity , are due to the fact that the electrons in the valence shell of a metal atoms can be removed easily. One characteristic of metals is their ability to be deformed without breaking. Malleability is the ability of a metal to be hammered into shapes. Ductility is the ability of a metal to be drawn into wire. Because the valence electrons can move freely, metals are good heat conductors and electrical conductors. [PAR] Summary of Common Properties [PAR] Solids at room temperature (except mercury) [PAR] High melting points[DOC] [TLE] Chemical elementA chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, Z).  There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth.  [PAR] Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe. However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15% of the matter in the universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of which is unknown, but it is not composed of chemical elements.  [PAR] The two lightest elements, hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants, where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed.  [PAR] The term ""element"" is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons (regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded, e.g. hydrogen in water) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element (e.g. hydrogen gas). For the second meaning, the terms ""elementary substance"" and ""simple substance"" have been suggested, but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature, whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used (e.g. French corps simple, Russian простое вещество).

"[DOC] [TLE] Dimple Records - Steel MagnoliasVideo ProductDimple Records - Steel MagnoliasVideo Product [PAR] 0 minutes [PAR] Notes / Reviews [PAR] Steel Magnolias is a 1989 comedy-drama film about the bond among a group of Southern women in northwest Louisiana. The movie is based on a 1987 off-Broadway play by Robert Harling and on the author's experience with the death of his sister. The title suggests the female characters are as delicate as magnolias but as tough as steel.(Scanlon, 2007) [PAR] Synopsis [PAR] The action centers on Truvy's beauty parlour and some women who regularly gather there. The drama begins on the morning of Shelby's wedding to Jackson and covers events over the next three years, including Shelby's decision to have a child despite having Type 1 diabetes and the complications that result from the decision. We also get a glimpse of the unlikely friendship between Clairee and Ouiser; Annelle's transformation from a shy, anxious newcomer in town to a good-time girl and then to a revival-tent Christian; and Truvy's relationships with the men in her family. Although the main storyline involves Shelby, her mother and Shelby's medical battles, the underlying group-friendship among all six women is prominent throughout the drama.Harling, Robert. Steel Magnolias. New York, NY: Dramatists Play Service, Inc. 1988. [PAR] Background [PAR] As noted in the Special Features on the Steel Magnolias DVD, the story of Steel Magnolias is based on the death of Robert Harling's younger sister, Susan Harling Robinson, a diabetic. As her best friend and closest sibling, Harling found it very difficult to cope with her death. He was advised by many of his friends to write about his feelings as a coping method. It began as a short story and evolved into a full length play due to the complexity of the relationships and emotions that existed within the characters. Harling felt it important to include the way the characters utilized humor and lighthearted conversations to assist them in coping with the seriousness of the underlying situations. Harling wanted the moviegoers to have a true experience of what his family endured during his sister's hospitalization. One of the ways he did this was by employing the nurses, doctors and other hospital staff that worked with his sister as characters in the movie portraying their real life roles. Because of the true to life situation, this movie is received by viewers in many different ways. [PAR] The setting for the movie is the fictional small town of Chinquapin, Louisiana which is located in the (also fictional) parish of Chinquapin. The movie was actually filmed in Natchitoches, Louisiana, which is located in Natchitoches Parish. [PAR] Stage play [PAR] The stage play, written by Robert Harling, is still popular today and has frequent productions mounted throughout the United States. It was originally staged Off-Broadway. All of the action of the play takes place solely on one set — Truvy's beauty salon, which is part of her house. There are only six characters (all female) that appear on stage. There is the voice of a DJ on the radio that is heard during the play. All the other characters (like the male characters) that appear in the film version are only referred to in the dialog. The original stage production opened at the WPA Theatre, in New York City, on 28 March 1987. It was directed by Pamela Berlin and featured Margo Martindale as Truvy, Constance Shulman as Annelle, Kate Wilkinson as Clairee, Mary Fogarty as Ouiser, Blanche Baker as Shelby and Rosemary Prinz as M'Lynn. The production moved to the Lucille Lortel Theatre on 19 June 1987, with Betsy Aidem taking over the role of Shelby. [PAR] The premiere London production was produced in 1989 at the Lyric Theatre.

As a result Blue Peter's producers took the unprecedented step of apologising on-air to viewers.

Is he really dead or alive? Thousands of the late music celebrity's fans still Google these and other questions. So, why is it that they don't believe it? By Ben Arogundade . [Apr.28.2016] [PAR] HE WAS THE KING OF POP, one of popular music’s most unique talents, who could sing, dance and write songs with equal skill, and who entertained and inspired a generation of loyal and fanatical fans across the world. [PAR] Despite his death in 2009, his name still resonates beyond the grave. Google, who collate and publish global Internet statistics, record 3,350,000 monthly searches for the name “Michael Jackson” alone. The search giant also records other interesting data that tells us much about how Jackson's online fans have reacted to his untimely death. For example, the question, “Is Michael Jackson still alive?” is currently searched approximately 20,000 times per month. In fact, the total number of search queries about when, where, how and why Michael Jackson died, and if he is really dead or still alive, amount to over 324,000 per year. [PAR] WHEN, WHERE, HOW, WHY DID MICHAEL JACKSON DIE? THE FACTS [PAR] These are the facts: Michael Jackson died, aged 50, in his rented home in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles on June 25, 2009, as he was preparing for a series of comeback music concerts at London’s 02 Arena. The cause of death was an overdose of the drugs Propofol and Benzodiazepine, following a cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner subsequently pronounced his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was tried and convicted of involuntary manslaughter on November 8, 2011. [PAR] JACKSON'S AFTERMATH [PAR] The autopsy conducted after the singer's death confirmed what Jackson and his family had maintained from the very beginning — that he indeed suffered from the skin condition vitiligo , and had not, as many claimed, deliberately bleached his skin because he was unhappy being black. [PAR] The public response to the news that Jackson was dead was extraordinary. The websites Twitter, Wikipedia and AOL Instant Messenger all crashed under the strain of frenetic activity as news spread worldwide. An estimated one billion people watched the music star's memorial service live on television, and 35 million additional albums of his were sold in the first year following his demise. [PAR] IS MICHAEL JACKSON REALLY DEAD OR ALIVE? [PAR] The circumstances surrounding his death, and the fanaticism of some of his fans, for whom he is nothing less than a pop deity, have led many to question whether or not the Grammy award-winning celebrity is actually dead. In similar fashion to the disbelief that greeted the death of Elvis Presley in 1977 amongst diehard fans, many Jackson fans are also in two minds. [PAR] The 20,000 Internet users worldwide that type the phrase, “Is Michael Jackson still alive?” into Google’s browser each and every month, are mostly fans that have heard one of the prevailing conspiracy theories that have peppered the blogosphere ever since the singer’s death. In true melodramatic fashion, they suggest that Jackson may have faked his own death, with the assistance of one of his many professional look-a-likes, in order to escape the pressures of his life under the spotlight, and his then massive debts. Of course, there is no proof of any of these wild claims, but they do serve one important purpose for diehard fans of the King Of Pop — and that is to keep his legacy alive.[DOC] [TLE] 'I'm better off dead.

Most of us only know of it as a Cold War foe of the United States, a very foreign country only a hundred miles away. It has been that way since Castro took power in the late 1950’s. First discovered by Christopher Columbus and claimed for Spain, this small island has been coveted by other countries for its entire history. It has a temperate climate, making it great for growing crops, and a location that was excellent for a stopping point after several months at sea. Spain was the primary owner of the island through most of its history, but it was not without a fight. The rich land attracted pirates and privateers from Britain and France to steal what treasures they could from Spanish ships. Once Spain allowed some flexibility in the colony’s trade, the floodgates opened and money came pouring into the coffers. They were filled primarily by two different crops; tobacco and sugar. Tobacco was very easy to process. Sugar was not. There was a complex system used to create sugar crystals, and the leftover molasses was a sticky mess to discard. This sets the backdrop for the creation of one of the finest cocktails in modern history: the Daiquiri. [PAR] During the turbulent struggle for naval supremacy, Spain and England traded blows around the edges of South America, the Caribbean, and anywhere there was water and unclaimed territory. Both sides used whatever means possible, including pirates and privateers, to gain an advantage in the resource rich Americas. The British were struggling to expand their foothold in the Americas; Spain was struggling to maintain the land they had, and the resources it was providing the ailing empire. The British were also struggling to stay sober on the seas. The sailors were provided a gallon of beer a day through a law passed in the 17th century. Due to the massive amount of beer they had to supply to a military force 4,500 miles away, a pint of rum was considered a fair substitute. It was easier to get, but far more potent. It was not until 1740 that someone was able to sober up the navy. Admiral Edward “Old Grog” Vernon ordered that the rum ration be mixed with water and citrus juice (usually limes) to dilute the potent spirit. This gave the English the edge of fighting a little more sober, and healthier. It also is one of the earliest known instances of the combination of lime juice, water, and rum, the base of what would become a Daiquiri. [PAR] Spain survived the encounters with Britain and held on to many of its American acquisitions for over a century, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and other islands a little too close to home for us. It did not sit well with a United States eager to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, asking European powers to kindly stay on their own side of the world. The biggest of the conflicts caused by this was the Spanish-American War, and Cuba had a starring role to play. They were seeking independence from Spain, and Colonel Theodore Roosevelt advocated helping them achieve it. The U.S. landed troops on a beach named Daiquiri, just a short distance away from an iron mine in Santiago. This “splendid little war” allowed the United States to occupy Cuba and do what Spain had done for centuries before; profit from the vast resources of the island. [PAR] One of the people making a healthy profit was Jennings Cox. He was one of the first iron miners on the island once it was safe, and generally credited with creating the original Daiquiri. The story goes that while he was entertaining guests one night, he ran out of the gin everyone was enjoying. He went out and purchased the easiest liquor he could find, which was rum. Adding lemons, sugar, mineral water, and ice to the rum, he turned it into a punch",Which spirit is used in a Daiquiri cocktail?,"['light rum', 'rum', 'dark rum']",323262001801411ab183c4d7a28ba0a7,"[{'end': [2266, 2463, 3988, 299, 4045, 2727], 'start': [2264, 2461, 3986, 297, 4043, 2725]}]","∃x (Spirit(x) ∧ UsedIn(x, DaiquiriCocktail))"

Enterprise on Star Trek [PAR] Captain James T. Kirk was the commander, star, and hero of the original 1960s sci-fi TV series Star Trek. As played by William Shatner , Captain Kirk was an impetuous fist-fighting alpha male, leading the multi-racial, mostly-human crew of the starship Enterprise on a series of space adventures throughout the universe. According to the futuristic mythology of the show, Kirk was promoted to captain of the Enterprise in 2264, and given a five-year mission ""to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."" He was assisted by his emotionless Vulcan science officer, Mr. Spock (played by Leonard Nimoy ), and the emotional Dr. McCoy (played by DeForest Kelley ). Capt. Kirk appeared in the original series (1966-69) and in seven feature films: Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979); Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982); Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984); Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986); Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989); Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991); and Star Trek: Generations (1994). A younger version of Kirk was played by actor Chris Pine in the 2009 feature Star Trek and its 2013 sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness. [PAR] Extra credit: [PAR] James T. Kirk's middle name is Tiberius... According to the official Star Trek history, James Kirk was born in Riverside, Iowa on 22 March 2233, and at age 34 became the youngest captain in Starfleet history. He died in 2371 after spending 78 years in a timeless energy distortion called the Nexus, which he entered in 2293... The call letters of the Enterprise were NCC 1701... According to the official Star Trek biography of Captain Kirk, his accolades include the Palm Leaf of the Axanar Peace Mission, the Grankite Order of Tactics, and the Prantares Ribbon of Commendation...

Assuming the ""C"" stands for ""circa"", this could be another indication of Gary's fallibility -- he didn't know when Kirk was born and had to guess. The range is 36.6 stardates, close to Kirk's age of 33 (we know he was 34 in The Deadly Years). The idea of 1 stardate = 1 year was obviously thrown out the airlock in later episodes. –  Keith Thompson",In the oringinal Star Trek what was Captain James Kirk's middle name?,['tiberius'],e618cea9be1946a981b0b7cc2bda829a,"[{'end': [1490, 2466], 'start': [1483, 2459]}]","∃x MiddleName(x, ""Captain James Kirk"")"

Appearing first as Rita Cansino, she agreed to change her name to Rita Hayworth and her hair color to dark red to attract a greater range in roles. Her appeal led to her being featured on the cover of Life magazine five times, beginning in 1940. The first dancer featured on film as a partner of both the stars Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly , Hayworth appeared in a total of 61 films over 37 years.

"[DOC] [TLE] German Chancellor - What Are His Or Her Powers And DutiesGerman Chancellor - What Are His Or Her Powers And Duties? [PAR] German Chancellor — What Are His/Her Powers & Duties? [PAR] Knowing how Germany operates and all about the German Chancellor is important for any citizen or knowledgeable traveler. First you must learn about the head of the government to fully understand the entire area. [PAR] The head of the government is the Chancellor of Germany, and he or she is called the Federal Chancellor. In German, the term is Bundeskanzler. To address this office you call a man Herr Bundeskanzler and a woman is Frau Bundeskanzlerin. [PAR] The Federal Chancellor heads the Federal government and is thus in charge of the executive branch. The Chancellor can’t be removed from office during his or her four-year term unless the Bundestag has agreed upon a successor. [PAR] Who Is The Chancellor Of Germany Currently? [PAR] Currently the German Chancellor is Angela Merkel. She was elected in 2005 as well as 2009 and 2013. She is the first female Chancellor of Germany. Forbes Magazine has said that she is the most powerful woman in the world. She has often been compared to Margaret Thatcher as being an “Iron Frau,” like Thatcher who was nicknamed “Iron Lady.” [PAR] How Does One Become The Chancellor Of Germany? [PAR] The Chancellor gets elected by the Bundestag once the proposal of the President is made. He or she must get voted in by the majority. This assures a stable government. And the voting is done by secret ballot. [PAR] If the person the President nominated is not elected, the Bundestag elects its own within two weeks. This has not occurred, however, in the years since 1949. [PAR] Some people refer to the German system of government as a Chancellor democracy. The Chancellor also determines who sits in the Federal Cabinet. He or she (currently “she”) can set how many cabinet ministers there are and dictate their duties. [PAR] The German Chancellor is responsible for all of the government policies. The formal guidelines issued by the Chancellor in Germany are legally binding and the cabinet ministers must implement them. The ministers also introduce policies at the ministerial levels which should reflect the Chancellor’s more encompassing guidelines. [PAR] Most legislation is actually initiated by the executive branch of the government, but the most responsibility lies with the Bundestag, otherwise known as the parliament of Germany. The Bundestag is elected by the German public and they in turn elect the Chancellor, so it all lies within the power of the people in reality. [PAR] Difference Between The President And The Chancellor In Germany [PAR] You may be wondering about the difference between the President and the Chancellor, which is a valid question. The President is the head of state and his duties are mostly representative and ceremonial. All the real power is exercised by the Federal Chancellor, though. [PAR] Now, it’s true that the President nominates a Chancellor, but the parliament must vote him or her in by majority, so it isn’t out of the control of the people’s government. And as stated earlier, the Bundestag can hold its own election should they not decide upon the nominee of the President. [PAR] The German Chancellor can be dismissed by the President, but again the Bundestag has to pass a vote of no confidence before anything really happens. The voices of the people are therefore heard loud and clear in all matters. ;-) [PAR] The Chancellor of Germany now faces all the challenges any executive of a country must face. She has held strong and is considered a woman of great strength. [PAR] Knowing the ins and outs of government in Germany and the responsibilities of the German Chancellor puts you ahead of the game in understanding what Germany is all about. Learn your facts well. It will serve you well in the long run.[DOC] [TLE] Chancellor of GermanyThe Chancellor of Germany is the head of government of Germany. The official title in German is Bundeskanzler(-in) (literally, Federal Chancellor), sometimes shortened to Kanzler(-in).

"[DOC] [TLE] Hematite in Feng Shui, Healing and JewelryHematite in Feng Shui, Healing and Jewelry [PAR] By Rodika Tchi [PAR] Updated January 10, 2017. [PAR] Even though in feng shui circles hematite is often called a crystal, it might be helpful to know that hematite is not a crystal , but a mineral (iron oxide). [PAR] While many stones can look similar to an untrained eye, the heavy and shiny hematite has a distinctive presence that cannot be confused with any other stone. [PAR] The name hematite derives it meaning from the greek word for ​blood. The reason for the origin of hematite's name can be twofold. [PAR] The hematite looks shiny black on the outside, but if you break the stone (not an easy thing to do!) you will see that on the inside hematite has a deep blood red colour . [PAR] Another reason for its name might be related to the high iron content found in hematite (almost 70%), which made hematite a popular healing stone for blood-related disorders. Because hematite has been used for such a long time, it has a wide variety of healing properties ascribed to it, from relieving leg cramps to alleviating fevers. The best way to find out the powers of hematite is to buy a stone and experiment yourself. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] Feng Shui Using Plants [PAR] Hematite is abundant, thus very affordable. [PAR] WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT HEMATITE? [PAR] Hematite clearly has a very strong grounding energy; you can feel that just by holding the stone in your hand. It also has a cooling and calming effect, as well as helps develop concentration and focus. Overall, hematite brings a quality of energy that is powerful, strong and grounding. It works with one's mind by calming it and clearing the unnecessary clutter . [PAR] WHERE DOES HEMATITE COME FROM? [PAR] Most of the hematite sold on the market comes from Brazil, Venezuela, USA and Canada. [PAR] WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC FENG SHUI PROPERTIES OF HEMATITE? [PAR] In feng shui , hematite is used for its grounding, calming, as well as protective properties. Hematite can also be energizing (in a balanced kind of way), so you can often find it in feng shui jewelry . [PAR] WHAT FORM OF HEMATITE SHOULD I CHOOSE? [PAR] Your chosen form will depend on the intended use of hematite. As with all crystals and stones that are quite affordable, it is good to have at least several tumbled rock hematites, because this way you can take them with you anywhere! From your car to your purse or office computer, you can place the hematite where it can help you with a burst of strong and cool, calming energy. [PAR] HOW ABOUT HEMATITE JEWELRY? [PAR] When it comes to jewelry , be sure to distinguish between hematite and magnetic hematite. Even though magnetic (man-made) hematite has its own interesting properties, I say best to choose the nature-made one! Most popular hematite jewelry options are bracelets and rings because they help ground your energy. [PAR] WHERE DO I PLACE THE HEMATITE FOR GOOD FENG SHUI? [PAR] The area of your home  bagua  that can benefit the most from the energy of hematite is the  Career  & Path in Life (North bagua area). You can also place the stone in the Creativity & Children  bagua area (West). [PAR] Hematite is also an excellent stone for one's study or  home office , as well as by the  front door  of your house. [PAR] If you want to bring a hematite carving into your home (or office) for good feng shui, you can find many small animal carvings in typical gift shops. [PAR] Choose an animal whose spirit you admire, combine it with the energy of hematite, and voila! - you've just got yourself a good feng shui cure!​[DOC] [TLE] About Magnetic Hematite - MagneticbeadingnbeyondAbout Magnetic Hematite [PAR] ABOUT US and OUR MAGNETIC HEMATITE JEWELRY, MAGNETIC THERAPY AND GEMSTONE METAPHYSICAL PROPERTIES [PAR] What is Magnetic Therapy?

[PAR] Shari Lewis ""the puppeteer to the baby boomers"" was once              described as having ""childlike excitement, an entertainers savvy and              a librarian's heart."" She began her career by winning three              appearances on ARTHUR GODFREY'S TALENTS SCOUTS radio program in              1952, and followed that success by starring in KARTOON CLUB on WRCA-TV              in 1953. [PAR] Set in the fairy town of Kartoonia, host Shari Lewis              interacted with Taffy Twinkle, a girl puppet (a redecorated turn of              the century ""Willie Talk"" doll); Randy Rocket, an outer space dummy              that she taught the ways of the Earth; and Pip Squeak, a              rubber-faced monkey who never spoke. Shari later appeared on her own              local New York program SHARI AND HER FRIENDS in 1954. [PAR] Her big break              came in 1956 when she appeared as the niece of Mr. Green Jeans (Hugh              Brannum) on the nationally televised CBS children's program CAPTAIN              KANGAROO. [PAR] She later starred on SHARILAND (1957), a Saturday              morning puppet program with Lamb Chop, Charlie Horse and Wing Ding,              a bird made of jersey cloth, sponge rubber and other parts. Shari's              hand puppets, Lamb Chop, Hush Puppy and Charlie Horse became her              most popular characters. [PAR] Lamb Chop was a shy, soft-spoken fleecy              little lamb about 6-years-old with a penchant for mischief and              wisecracks; Charlie Horse was a cocky, bucktoothed 10-year-old; and              Hush Puppy was a sweet 7-year-old Mortimer Snerd-like country cousin              of Lamb Chop. [PAR] When THE HOWDY DOODY SHOW was canceled in 1960, Shari              Lewis replaced that popular children's program with her own              30-minute series THE SHARI LEWIS SHOW/NBC/1960-63 that featured Lamb              Chop, Hush Puppy, Charlie Horse, Mr. Goodfellow (Ronald Radd) and              Jump Pup (Jackie Warner). [PAR] Some 15 years later, Shari starred on THE              SHARI LEWIS SHOW/NBC/SYN/1975-77, a 30-minute takeoff of THE MARY              TYLER MOORE SHOW with pro-social storylines with a staff of              twenty-five animal puppets including Lamb Chop and a kangaroo named              Captain Person who worked for Bearly Broadcasting Studios (BBS). [PAR] Shari Lewis began ventriloquism at the age of eleven by playing with              dolls and puppets around the house. According to Shari Lewis, her              puppet Lamb Chop was born when her father, Dr. Abraham B. Hurwitz (a              professor of education at Yeshiva University and an accomplished              magician) said ""If Mary had a little lamb, why not Shari?"" By              practicing at home in front of a mirror, Shari improvised her way to              stardom. [PAR] Shari's talents inspired her to write a number of books              including her first book ""The Shari Lewis Puppet Book"" (Citadel Press,              1958); and a series of thirty-six ""Kids Only Club"" books commissioned              by Holt Rinehart & Winston in 1979 that taught kids crafts and              entrepreneurial skills. [PAR] Shari has also produced the videos Have I              Got a Story for You; 101 Things For Kids To Do; and a CD entitled Lamb Chop in the Land of No Manners (A & M Video).

Find out which bird it was, and how the eagle was chosen. [PAR] 11-01-2007                  //         NWF Staff [PAR] Nations often adopt animals as symbols: England has its lion, India its peacock. On the afternoon of July 4, 1776, just after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Continental Congress appointed a committee made up of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin to select a design for an official national seal. [PAR] The three patriots had different ideas and none of them included the bald eagle. They finally agreed on a drawing of the woman Liberty holding a shield to represent the states. But the members of Congress weren't inspired by the design and they consulted with William Barton, a Philadelphia artist who produced a new design that included a golden eagle. [PAR] Because the golden eagle also flew over European nations, however, the federal lawmakers specified that the bird in the seal should be an American bald eagle . On June 20, 1782, they approved the design that we recognize today. [PAR] At the time, the new nation was still at war with England, and the fierce-looking bird seemed to be an appropriate emblem. But from the start, the eagle was a controversial choice. Franklin scowled at it. ""For my part,"" he declared, ""I wish the eagle had not been chosen as the representative of this country. He is a bird of bad moral character; he does not get his living honestly. You may have seen him perched in some dead tree where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the labor of the fishing hawk and, when that diligent bird has at length taken a fish and is bearing it to his nest for his young ones, the bald eagle pursues him and takes the fish. With all this injustice, he is never in good case."" [PAR] Some people have since questioned whether the eagle would have been chosen to adorn the seal had the nation not been at war. A year after the Treaty of Paris ended the conflict with Great Britain, Franklin argued that the turkey would have been a more appropriate symbol. ""A much more respectable bird and a true native of America,"" he pointed out. Franklin conceded that the turkey was ""a little vain and silly,"" but maintained that it was nevertheless a ""bird of courage"" that ""would not hesitate to attack a grenadier of the British guards who should presume to invade his farm yard with a red coat on."" Congress was not convinced, however. The eagle remained our national symbol. [PAR] In truth, both the turkey and the bald eagle are native to the Americas. But if the issue is a bird that represents our nation , Americans can't really lay exclusive claim to either species, since both traditionally ranged in Canada and Mexico as well.

"[DOC] [TLE] [CD] Steve Hackett - audio-music.info[CD] Steve Hackett [PAR] Main Page | Top | Biography  | Albums  [PAR] Stephen Richard ""Steve"" Hackett (born February 12, 1950, in Pimlico, England) is a writer and guitarist. He first gained prominence in the British rock group Genesis in 1970. Before joining Genesis as a 20-year-old, he played in a number of bands, his first recording being with Quiet World. Hackett's writing, combined with his unique sound and inventive playing contributed greatly to Genesis' success and he remained with the band for eight albums before leaving in 1977 to pursue a solo career. [PAR] Steve The Innovator [PAR] Steve Hackett is renowned for his innovative and ethereal guitar work and for being a master of a myriad of guitar techniques, including tapping. Though many people often credit Eddie Van Halen for inventing this technique, it was actually Hackett who first mastered it. Songs which showcase Hackett's use of the tapping technique, are ""The Musical Box"", ""Return of the Giant Hogweed"", ""The Fountain of Salmacis"", ""Supper's Ready"" and ""Dancing With the Moonlit Knight"". Steve had mentioned that if he'd known that tapping was going to become as popular as it did during the 80s, he would have made an entire album dedicated to it. Steve is also known for his expert classical guitar playing. The song ""Horizons"" is one of the most enduring classical guitar pieces produced during that era. Another great classic is the intro to the song ""Blood on the Rooftops"", which is still a staple at Steve's live concerts. In the late 1970s he became one of the first and most adventurous experimenters with analogue, and later digital, guitar synthesizers to enrich the textures of his work. Whatever its artistic merits, it is worth noting that the dramatic 'plane crash' sequence at the beginning of 'Tiger Moth' was performed solo on an early Roland analogue guitar synth. Hackett's guitar solo in the song ""Firth of Fifth"", from Genesis' 1973 Selling England by the Pound album, is considered by many to be one of the great electric guitar solos. [PAR] Solo Voyage [PAR] In 1975 while still a member of Genesis, Hackett released his first solo album, Voyage of the Acolyte which was met with critical and commercial acclaim. With the success of his first solo venture under his belt, he left Genesis in 1977 after the tour in support of Wind & Wuthering. Steve's last work as a nominal member of Genesis can be heard on the live album, Seconds Out, released in late 1977. [PAR] Solo Career [PAR] After leaving Genesis in late 1977 Steve released Please Don't Touch and, with the success of his first two albums, assembled a touring line-up that would help in the creation of his next two releases, Spectral Mornings and Defector. In the 1980s Steve released his first classical guitar albums Bay of Kings and Momentum which further enhanced his reputation. The tour for Momentum drew large crowds in Europe, considered unusual for a classical guitarist! In 1986, Hackett formed the supergroup GTR with former Yes and Asia guitarist Steve Howe and released a gold-selling album. Steve's solo career continued, releasing a plethora of both electric and acoustic based albums througout the 90s into the present day. One of his most memorable recordings was the neo-classical influenced A Midsummer Night's Dream which showcases his impeccable virtuosity, accompanied by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Steve's younger brother John was much involved (as flute player and second guitarist) in his 1970s bands, and has often appeared as musician and collaborator on his more recent work, particularly on the ambitious 'Sketches of Satie' arranged for flute and guitar, from year 2000. [PAR] Influence [PAR] Of the five members that made up the ""classic"" Genesis quintet the most enigmatic was Steve Hackett. However many of Genesis' peers and concertgoers took notice and he has become one of the UK's most influential guitarists. Those who claimed Steve Hackett as an influence include Alex Lifeson, Yngwie Malmsteen, Francis Dunnery, Roine Stolt and Mike Holmes. Hackett has cited his own","Who played guitar for Genesis from 1970 to 1977, before going on to form Supergroup GTR with Steve Howe from Yes?",['steve hackett'],e5f9e495885840458c03617ecaed6636,"[{'end': [66, 29, 4001, 149, 662, 3845], 'start': [54, 17, 3989, 136, 650, 3833]}]","∃x (PlayedGuitarForGenesis(x, 1970, 1977) ∧ FormedGTR(x, Steve Howe))"

Like the common wasp, it is striped but, instead of being black and yellow, it has chestnut-brown and yellowy-orange stripes. The head consists of stout antennae, two ‘c’ shaped eyes and three round simple eyes. [PAR] Conservation status [PAR] This is a generally peaceful, non-aggressive species. It is not currently threatened. [PAR] Details [PAR] Did you know? [PAR] Hornets are the largest eusocial wasps; some species can reach up to 55 mm (2.2 in) in length. [PAR] How to recognise [PAR] The hornet is easily Identifiable by its large size (being Britian's largest social wasp -  up to 35mm long). Like the common wasp, it is striped, but, instead of being black and yellow, it has brown and yellow stripes. The head consists of stout antennae, two ‘c’ shaped eyes and three round simple eyes. The hornet usually nests in hollow trees and wall cavities, building with very brittle yellowish paper. Although it has a powerful sting it tends to be less aggressive than our other wasps. [PAR] Where to see [PAR] Hornets in Britain are found predominately in the south; however they are spreading northwards. They favour wooded areas, building their papery nests in hollow trees. The habitat must have a plentiful supply of insects, which are the main food for both adults and larvae. At NWT Foxley Wood , hornets have taken advantage of some of the bat boxes that have been put up. However, these often prove to be too small for the hornet colony and they will often have to build a second nest and relocate the colony to a new site. [PAR] When to see [PAR] In spring, usually May, the queen emerges from hibernation and begins to build her papery nest. The queen lays eggs which hatch into smaller (18-25mm ) sterile female workers.

"[DOC] [TLE] A Guide To An Easy Moussaka Recipe | Knowzo.comA Guide To An Easy Moussaka Recipe | Knowzo.com [PAR] A Guide To An Easy Moussaka Recipe [PAR] Read our Disclaimer [PAR] If you love Greek food then chances are that you've fallen in love with the famous eggplant or potato-based Moussaka. This dish that often uses some type of ground meat has been very popular not only in Greece but in other regions of the world like Arabia, the Balkans, and Turkey. No matter who you are, when the springtime finally starts to peak out from beneath the frozen ground, thoughts of Moussaka immediately come to mind. But if you're not used to this type of cooking you might feel intimidated in taking on such a recipe. You can try a relatively easy Moussaka recipe to help you overcome any inhibitions you might have. [PAR] The Meat: [PAR] There has been quite a debate about the type of meat that should be used in a good Mousssaka. True Greeks will insist that the best meat of choice should be lamb while others prefer to use veal or pork. But in some parts of the world, these choice meats are not always easy to find or when you can find them, they may be very expensive. In those cases, beef can also be used. Those experienced in making Moussaka say that more important than the choice meat you use is how it is prepared. According to most chefs, any meat you use must be minced. While it does require a little extra work in order to make sure that you get the best results in an easy Moussaka recipe, they suggest that you use a mincing machine. [PAR] The Sauce: [PAR] In a good Moussaka, the common ingredient is tomato sauce. While there are several variations found around the world, Moussaka chefs will tell you that the closer you stick to the traditional version, the better results you'll get in the final dish. The tomato sauce uses a good amount of red wine to assure its richness and should have a sweet and spicy taste to it. [PAR] The Aubergine: [PAR] The third ingredient that you must take care with is the aubergine or eggplant. With layers of the bitter purple and pale green vegetable, you add a little texture to round out the dish. It is recommended that before it is included in the recipe that you brush them with a little oil and then bake the aubergine for about 25 minutes or until they soften up. [PAR] The Topping: [PAR] The final key ingredient in your Moussaka is the topping. Usually this is made up of a simple bechamel (butter, flour, and milk) whisked into eggs and filled out with yogurt. If made properly, it will puff up when in the oven to make a beautiful covering for the whole dish. [PAR] While most people think that the dish is very complicated, if you pay very close attention to the four main ingredients you can create your own easy Moussaka recipe. Once you've mastered these basic fundamentals you'll be able to branch out and begin making your own creative versions of the dish. So, the next time spring comes around and you're ready for something special to welcome the warm weather, don't shy away from this flavorful dish.

[PAR] Even with the longer running time, it's still not the story but all the gags and musical talent of the Marx Brothers that is on parade here and is the selling point of the film. That was normal procedure for them. In this edition, the gag scenes were longer and the amount of music was much greater. [PAR] The major skits involve a race track tout (Chico conning Groucho) , a physical exam (Margaret Dumont, who else?), a delay of the big horse race and a bunch of other crazy skits. Some are good, some go on too long. [PAR] Maureen O'Sullivan, of Tarzan fame among other films, gives the film some beauty and Dumont is treated with more respect here than in the other Marx Brothers films. Groucho takes it easy on her because her character has the money that will save the day, so to speak. [PAR] This MB film has a ton of music, from Chico on piano, to Harpo with harp and flute solos plus a flute number with a group of black folks. Then there is Allan Jones crooning away to O'Sullivan with several ballads. Also, there are several group numbers featuring the aforementioned group of blacks . I liked their rousing gospel numbers best of all the music. [PAR] The ending of this movie reminded me of Horse Feathers, in which the most outrageous football game was ever filmed. Here, it was a horse race, unlike any you would ever see. It is so ridiculous, you just laugh out loud....and that's the idea of the movie. [PAR] Was the above review useful to you? [PAR] 25 out of 30 people found the following review useful: [PAR] hilarious; 9/10 [PAR] from Saint Paul, MN [PAR] 25 June 2001 [PAR] I haven't seen enough of the Marx Brothers' films to say which is their best and which is their worst. I have seen Duck Soup, which I would say has to be at least one of their best, seeing that I believe it to be one of the funniest comedies ever. I have also seen A Night at the Opera, which is also often considered one of their best, often the best. I myself found it much less funny than Duck Soup. I wanted to kill myself during the musical numbers of that film. [PAR] Now I've seen A Day at the Races, the Brothers' follow up to A Night at the Opera, a smash hit in theaters. Generally, Races is considered a weak follow-up to a great film. I disagree. I liked A Day at the Races much more than A Night at the Opera (but a bit less than Duck Soup). All three Brothers are firing bullseye after bullseye. Harpo could stand to do a little bit more. He may have had the funniest role in Duck Soup. He was an utter maniac with total disregard for human life. When the Marx Brothers left Paramount for MGM, their edge was dulled down a bit. Oh well, Races still succeeds. [PAR] Also, except for the boring opera voice, even the musical numbers work here. I love to watch Chico play the piano. That's hilarious. Harpo's harp number is less good, but still not bad. The ballet sequence is also quite good. There's one more musical number that's just fantastic: the poor black folk singing ""Who's that man?"" as Harpo runs around playing the flute.

"[DOC] [TLE] Melanie Gold Greatest Hits - melaniemusic.comMelanie Gold Greatest Hits [PAR] Sleeve notes by John Tobbler. 1993 [PAR] Melanie [PAR] Singer/songwriter Melanie Safka was a huge star for around 18 months in 1970/1, a period when she was rarely absent from the US singles chart. [PAR] Born on February 3, 1947, in the Queens area of New York, she lived in Long Branch, New Jersey, as a teenager, before attending the American Academy Of Dramatic Arts. [PAR] By 1967, she had signed a publishing contract with Peter Schekeryk, who later became her manager and also her husband, but her initial record deal produced little in the way of success. However, she had begun to write excellent songs, and her luck changed dramatically soon after she was signed by Buddah Records in 1969. A song she had written and recorded, ""Look What They've Done To My Song, Ma?"", became a hit in France, perhaps partly because one of it's verses was written and sung in French - ""Ils ont change my chanson, Ma?"" - and a cover version by the New Seekers was a hit under the title ""What Have They've Done To My Song, Ma?"" in both the US, where it reached the Top 20, and in Britain. In 1971, The New Seekers followed up that debut US hit with two more chart entries, both featuring songs written by Melanie, ""Beautiful People"" and ""Nickel Song"". By then, Melanie had registered her own US hit single with a song she wrote after appearing at, and being inspired by, the Woodstock Festival: ""Lay Down (Candles In The Rain)"", which made the US Top 10, and later became a notable part of the stage act of British rock band Mott The Hoople. Fronted by the charismatic Ian Hunter. Melanie followed up this breakthrough with another hit, ""Peace Will Come"", before perhaps her most memorable single of that early era, her unforgettable cover version of ""Ruby Tuesday"", the Rolling Stones hit, which became her UK Top 10 debut as well as reaching the US chart. [PAR] At that point, Melanie was extremely popular all over the world, and was regarded by millions as the finest female-singer/songwriter of the era - her concerts, attended by adoring audiences whom she would invite to sit on the stage while she performed, became internationally famous. She was still sharing the stage with dozens of members of her audience when she performed at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1975, and there might have been a hundred or more of her disciples sitting at her feet as she sang her songs with a child-like innocence which many still find irresistible. This innocence, combined with her passionate vocal style, made Melanie a role model for many young women in the early 1970s; her essentially gentle approach, which seemed to be tinged with an inner strength, captivated the hearts of her many female fans, as well as those of their escorts, who tended to be rather gentle themselves. [PAR] Sadly, this substantial commercial success inevitably had to come to an end, although Melanie's unique talents were still obvious to anyone who heard her records or saw her concerts. She and Schekeryk formed their own record company, Neighbourhood Records, and while her first single on her own label, ""Brand New Key"", was a huge international hit, topping the US chart and selling over a million copies, she was never again able to equal its success. Not that she had completely stopped having hits, as ""Ring The Living Bell"" proved in 1972, but inevitably , fashions in popular music tend to change as frequently as the wind, and in that year, the tide turned for Melanie, and her popularity with record buyers, which had previously made her a million-selling performer, suddenly declined as her audience discovered new stars like Rod Stewart. [PAR] Melanie Safka is still a star, but these days her domain is the concert hall rather than the recording studio. Many of her original fans still go to see her perform at venues around the world, knowing they will feel uplifted","What song has provided hit singles for the Rolling Stones, Melanie and Rod Stewart?",['ruby tuesday'],4df37d3ebe2745bd895eec7968e16ef4,"[{'end': [1843], 'start': [1832]}]","∃song (ProvidedHitSinglesFor(song, ""The Rolling Stones"") ∧ ProvidedHitSinglesFor(song, ""Melanie"") ∧ ProvidedHitSinglesFor(song, ""Rod Stewart""))"
"[DOC] [TLE] Why Last Action Hero failed—and why it deserves to be ...Why Last Action Hero failed—and why it deserves to be rediscovered · For Our Consideration · The A.V. Club [PAR] Share Tweet [PAR] Arnold Schwarzenegger has built his career on negating suspension of disbelief. He plays characters with comically Anglo names like Ben Richards and Howard Langston, despite looking and sounding exactly like an Austrian ex-bodybuilder. He’s good at squinting, smirking, and standing up while keeping his back straight, but not at convincing the viewer that he’s anyone other than Arnold Schwarzenegger. [PAR] His screen appeal lies in his un-believability. He’s incapable of disappearing into a role (though he comes close in The Terminator). Instead of becoming the character, the character becomes him. That’s the central conceit of his comedies; the humor depends on the viewer recognizing Schwarzenegger and thinking that it’s funny to see him do something un-Schwarzeneggerian. This is also the reason why most of his comedies are pretty bad. [PAR] Yet, despite his non-existent range, Schwarzenegger has continually taken on projects that either cast him as a character with multiple identities (Raw Deal, Total Recall, True Lies, Escape Plan) or require him to play multiple characters (The 6th Day, the Terminator franchise). This results in a Hollywood hall of mirrors: Schwarzeneggers interacting with other Schwarzeneggers; Schwarzenegger pretending to be Schwarzenegger; Schwarzenegger discovering that he’s not the Schwarzenegger he believed himself to be, but a different, identical Schwarzenegger. [PAR] No movie takes the multiple-Schwarzenegger trope further than Last Action Hero, an elastic meta-action-comedy that was considered a resounding commercial and critical failure in 1993. The victim of its own marketing campaign, the movie made $137 million at the box office (equivalent to about $222 million in today’s dollars), but still managed to lose money, because so much had been spent on advertising. [PAR] Heavy cross-promotion didn’t exactly endear it to the press, nor did the then-prevailing impression that Last Action Hero was an extension of the Schwarzenegger brand, a Planet Hollywood theme restaurant in feature form. But blaming Last Action Hero’s comparative failure on advertising isn’t accurate; after all, Jurassic Park was just as aggressively promoted. (Of course, many of those involved with the movie would eventually come to blame Jurassic Park—which opened the week before Last Action Hero and became a runaway hit—for their movie’s “failure.”)   [PAR] Rather, the reason why Last Action Hero didn’t become a massive blockbuster rests in the film itself. It’s a mutant that can’t be categorized, both a straightforward action movie and a Joe Dante-style gag-a-minute fantasy. It doesn’t make much sense. It’s the only truly funny comedy of Schwarzenegger’s career, and it’s overtly about Schwarzenegger, and yet none of its best jokes are related to Schwarzenegger’s screen persona. At times, it’s brilliant and demented. [PAR] When Last Action Hero opened, one of the most common complaints made by critics was that the film—about a boy who magically enters a Schwarzenegger movie and then brings its protagonist back with him into “reality”—didn’t properly distinguish between the real world and the world of the movie-within-the-movie, and never defined the parameters of either.  [PAR] For instance, after Danny (Austin O’Brien) gets sucked into the fictional Schwarzenegger vehicle Jack Slater IV, he discovers that characters from other movies, like Terminator 2: Judgment Day’s T-1000 (Robert Patrick), also inhabit this universe. But if T-1000 is a real person in the movie-within-the-movie, then why does Terminator 2 also exist in the same world (albeit as a Sylvester Stallone vehicle)? If Schwarzenegger’s Jack Slater loses his invulnerability upon entering Danny’s “real” world, then why do other movie characters—like Death (Ian McKellen) from The Seventh Seal—retain their powers after getting freed from their movies?

The brothers were supremely confident live performers, both with their trademark Gibson Dove and later, black J50 guitars. By the end of the 50s they were the world's number 1 vocal group. Amazingly, their career gained further momentum when, after signing with the newly formed Warner Brothers Records for $1 million, they delivered a song that was catalogued WB1. This historical debut was the superlative ""Cathy's Clown"", written by Don. No Everly record had sounded like this before; the echo-laden production and the treble-loaded harmonies ensured that it stayed at number 1 in the USA for five weeks. The brothers continued to release immaculate records; many of them reached the US Top 10, although in England their success was even greater, with two further number 1 hits during 1961. Again the echo and treble dominated in two more classics, ""Walk Right Back"" and a fast-paced reworking of the former Bing Crosby hit ""Temptation."" Don became dependent on drugs, and the pressures from constant touring and recording began to show; during one historic night at London's East Ham Granada, England, a nervous Phil performed solo. The standard ""food poisoning/exhaustion"" excuse was used. What was not known by the doting fans was that Don had attempted a suicidal drug overdose twice in 48 hours. Phil completed the tour solo. Don's addiction continued for another three years, although they were able to work during part of this time. [PAR] The advent of the beat boom pushed the brothers out of the spotlight and while they continued to make hit records, none approached their previous achievements.

[PAR] Search [PAR] When Is Sex Not ""Sexual Relations""? [PAR] By Richard Lacayo [PAR] When Bill Clinton gave his deposition in the Paula Jones case, he said he had never had ""sexual relations"" with Monica Lewinsky. But Lewinsky has reportedly testified to a number of acts that most people think of as sex. Can both statements somehow be true? Is it possible that the two of them had intimate contact, yet Clinton still did not perjure himself? In the intricate world of the law, a world of hairsplitting distinctions where the President is famously at home, it just may be so. Here's why. [PAR] At Clinton's deposition, Jones' legal team asked Judge Susan Webber Wright to approve a very precise, three-part definition of sexual relations. Clinton's attorney Robert Bennett objected to the whole definition, but to the last two parts especially, as being too broad. Wright agreed to disallow parts 2 and 3, leaving only the first, narrowest definition of sex in place. [PAR] With that, Clinton may have been given the room to offer a technically ""true"" denial to the question of whether he had sex with Lewinsky--even if she happened to perform fellatio on him. The truncated definition characterizes sex in terms of a checklist of body parts, including the genitals, breast and thigh. Oral sex would not necessarily require the President to touch anything on Lewinsky that appears on that list. Strange as it may sound, under one reading of the definition, Lewinsky could have been having sex with him (because she was ""touching"" the President's genitals) while at the same moment, he was not having sex with her. (At the deposition, Clinton wasn't asked if she had sexual relations with him, just if he had them with her.) Isn't the law a wonderfully intricate device? [PAR] There are problems with the legalistic defense. For one thing, if Clinton and Lewinsky did have oral sex, is it really likely that he did not touch any body parts mentioned in the Jones definition? (Lewinsky has testified that Clinton fondled her.) And because that definition says that a person engages in sex if he or she ""causes"" contact with the genitals of ""any person,"" it could be argued that Clinton caused Lewinsky's contact with his, even if he did not otherwise touch her. He could reply that she was the cause, or at least the active partner, while he was merely the passive receiver, but that makes him seem like either an implausibly shrinking violet or a very cool customer. Beyond all that, Lewinsky's secret grand-jury testimony may simply be so detailed and explicit that it leaves no room for loopholes. [PAR] Even if the word-wiggle keeps Clinton out of the perjury trap, it won't help him politically because it doesn't account for his Jan. 26 televised insistence that he ""did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky."" When he spoke before the cameras, the lawyerly definition of sex wasn't in force. And in a recent TIME/CNN poll, 87% of those questioned said that oral sex was, well, sex. Hiding behind the ultimate tortuous legalism could help the President get through his testimony, but it won't pass the laugh test with the American people--which is why Clinton won't be parsing the meaning of ""sexual relations"" in any public statements.            --By Richard Lacayo.

While Murray was easing to a 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 third-round victory over Australia’s John Millman on Centre Court, the Scot’s greatest rival, Novak Djokovic, was beaten by Sam Querrey on Court One in the most unexpected Grand Slam result of the year so far. [PAR] Murray will next play either Nick Kyrgios or Feliciano Lopez. The Australian and the Spaniard will resume their third-round match on Sunday after play was halted because of fading light shortly after 9pm on Saturday with the score at one set apiece. [PAR] While Murray is seen by the bookmakers as the man to beat over the next eight days, the Scot insists that Djokovic’s defeat will have no impact on his thinking. “If I was to reach the final, then it may have some bearing, but it doesn’t right now,” he said. “My draw’s still exactly the same. The matches, in the next round especially, are tough. Nick and Feli are both very, very good grass-court players.  [PAR] Djokovic sensationally knocked out by Querrey [PAR] “The bookies don’t always get it right. They made a few mistakes over the last few weeks across a number of different things. Your job is to go out there and try to win the matches that are there in front of you.” [PAR] With Rafael Nadal absent because of injury and Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka out of the tournament, Murray and Roger Federer are the only two top-five players left in the men’s singles. Murray is through to the last 16 of his 22nd Grand Slam tournament in succession after his 49th Wimbledon victory took him one clear of the total of wins enjoyed at the All England Club by his coach, Ivan Lendl. [PAR] “I think I’m playing well,” Murray said. “Some of the tennis I played at the end of the matches, in particular the third sets of both the last two matches, has been very good.” [PAR] Andy Murray and Roger Federer are the only survivors from the top five players in the men's draw (Getty) [PAR] On another day of frequent breaks for rain Murray might have been grateful that his match was staged on Centre Court, but it was not without its interruptions. With the sun shining at the start the roof was left open, but the players had to leave the court because of rain after the first point of the second set. When they returned it started raining again within two points of the resumption, which prompted the closure of the roof for the rest of the match. [PAR] As has become customary on the second Saturday here, the Royal Box was full of major sporting figures, including members of England’s 1966 World Cup-winning team.

"[DOC] [TLE] Wright brothers | Biography, Inventions and FactsWright brothers | Biography, Inventions and Facts [PAR] Wright brothers [PAR] Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur invented “Airplane”. [PAR] Orville and Wilbur Wright, known famously as the Wright Brothers, were American pioneers in the field of aviation and are recognized for inventing and building the world’s first successful airplane and making the first human flight in 1903. Wilbur (1867-1912) and Orville (1871-1948) were two of seven children born to Milton Wright and Susan Catherine Koerner. Neither of the brothers received high school diplomas; Orville dropped out of high school to start a printing business and Wilbur became socially withdrawn after an accident with a hockey stick which caused him the loss of his front teeth. Wilbur stayed at home to care for his mother who was suffering from tuberculosis. [PAR] Wilbur did not attend Yale as he had initially planned. Wright brothers worked together in their printing business for a brief period, before joining in on the nation-wide bicycle craze. They opened up a sales and repair shop known as the Wright Cycle Exchange, later changed to Wright Cycle Company. They even began manufacturing their own brand of bicycles, but their main area of interest always remained aviation. This interest stemmed from their childhood, when their father bought them a toy helicopter based on an invention by a French aeronautical engineer named Alphonse Pénaud. The brothers were fascinated with it and played with it until it broke; after which they designed and built their own. They were also keenly interested in kites and used to build their own models. [PAR] In the 1890s a German named Otto Lilienthal successfully managed a manual air glide, an event which fascinated both brothers. Although Lilienthal was subsequently killed in flight, the Wright Brothers were not discouraged. They felt that all that was needed to make a successful flight was practice. They felt that the wings and the engine were developed enough, and the missing factor was control. In this regard, they differed considerably from other aeronautical experts of the time who felt that a powerful engine was the key to a successful flight. The Wright Brothers observed birds in flight and mimicked the motion of their machine on the same pattern. [PAR] In 1900, the brothers went to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina to begin their gliding experiments. They chose this location based on research about the wind and weather conditions there. The Wrights used the research conducted by other aviation pioneers to design and develop their glider. The design of their flying machine evolved over the years of their research. It has been noted that Wilbur did most of the flying as he wanted to protect his younger brother Orville from any harm. After years of experiments, amendments and research, the first successful, manned flight in history was made by Wilbur Wright on December 17th, 1903, witnessed by five people. The flight lasted only 12 seconds and covered 120 feet but it was a remarkable feet and the first of its kind in history. [PAR] The brothers’ success became a worldwide phenomenon and they started taking passengers on board their flights.  The world’s longest flight at the time lasted 2 hours and 19 minutes. The first fatal air crash took place in 1908 in a flight manned by Orville which he survived, but the passenger did not. In 1909, the US Government bought its first plane manufactured by the Wright Brothers for $25,000 with a bonus of $5,000 because the speed of the plane exceeded 40 mph. The Wright Brothers’ planes also became the world’s first military airplanes. Both brothers remained unmarried; Wilbur died at the age of 45 from typhoid and Orville of a heart attack at the age of 77. They remained friends and partners throughout their lives and never tried to discredit the other from the amazing and seemingly impossible feats that they accomplished together.[DOC] [TLE] The Wright Brothers | The First Successful AirplaneThe Wright Brothers | The First Successful Airplane [PAR] View the 1903 Wright Flyer up close and in detail.

"[DOC] [TLE] The Lion Sleeps Tonight by The Tokens SongfactsThe Lion Sleeps Tonight by The Tokens Songfacts [PAR] The Lion Sleeps Tonight by The Tokens Songfacts [PAR] Songfacts [PAR] The original title was ""Mbube,"" which means ""lion."" It was a hunting song originally sung in Zulu in what is now Swaziland. [PAR] This was popularized in the 1930s by South African singer Solomon Linda, who recorded it in 1939 with his group, The Evening Birds. Apparently they were a bold bunch, and got the idea for this from when they used to chase lions who were going after the cattle owned by their families. [PAR] This was recorded in South Africa, where it was a big hit. Around 1948, the South African record company sent a copy to Decca Records in the US, hoping to get it distributed there. Folk singer Pete Seeger got a hold of it and started working on an English version. [PAR] In the 1950s, Miriam Makeba recorded this with the Zulu lyrics, and Pete Seeger recorded it with his band, The Weavers (who dominated the charts with ""Goodnight Irene""). The Weavers recorded the refrain of the song (no verses) and called it ""Wimoweh."" Their version hit #15 on the US Best Sellers charts in 1952. In 1957, it was included on, The Weavers At Carnegie Hall, a very popular album in the world of folk music. [PAR] Seeger thought they were saying ""Wimoweh"" on the original, and that's what he wrote down and how it was recorded in English. They were actually saying ""Uyimbube,"" which means ""You're a Lion."" It was misheard for ""Wimeoweh"" because when pronounced, Uyimbube sounds like: oo-yim-bweh-beh. [PAR] Hank Medress, Jay Siegel, and Phil and Mitch Margo, who made up The Tokens, had a Top 15 hit ""Tonight I Fell in Love"" in 1960, but didn't have a record label in 1961. They auditioned for producers Hugo and Luigi (Peretti and Creatore) by singing ""Wimoweh"" to them. Hugh and Luigi were impressed by the performance but decided that the song needed new lyrics. With help from George Weiss, Hugo and Luigi rewrote the song, giving it the title ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight."" The Tokens thought this had been nothing more than an elaborate audition - ""Who is gonna buy a song about a lion sleeping"" was their general sentiment. They were so embarrassed with the new title and lyrics that they fought the release of the recording (it was scheduled to be the B-side of another ""import,"" a Portuguese song that they recorded in the same May 1961 session, ""Tina""). [PAR] Influential disc jockey Murray the K pushed ""Tina,"" but once a New England DJ started playing the B-side on the air, ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" started its climb to the #1 position, hitting the top of the charts in the Christmas holidays of 1961-62. [PAR] The run at #1 for ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" was interrupted by a unique event: the return to #1 by Chubby Checker's ""The Twist"" 17 months after it hit the top spot on the Hot 100 for the first time. [PAR] The Kingston Trio recorded this in 1959 on their Live From The Hungry i LP. When introducing the song, singer Dave Guard stated that ""Mbube"" was a song about a sleeping lion (he doesn't refer to the song by name: he gives the background of the song before the Trio sings it). Part of the translated lyrics, as given by Guard: ""Hush! Hush! If we all be quiet, there will be lion meat for dinner.""

"[DOC] [TLE] The Pirate EncyclopediaThe Pirate Encyclopedia [PAR] known as Blackbeard, was a [PAR] notorious English pirate in the [PAR] Caribbean Sea during the early [PAR] 18th century. [PAR] Blackbeard's real name is not [PAR] definitely known, though he was [PAR] generally called Edward Teach. [PAR] Nevertheless, he is refered to in [PAR] some documents as Edward [PAR] Thatch or even as Edward [PAR] Drummond. He is thought to [PAR] have been born in Bristol, but [PAR] some writers claim Jamaica as his home. Teach (or Thatch) went to sea at an early age. He served on an English privateer in the War of Spanish Succession. At the war's end in 1713, Teach, like many other privateers, turned to piracy. [PAR] Blackbeard The Pirate [PAR] Teach began as a pirate under Benjamin Hornigold. In 1717, Hornigold retired, taking advantage of an amnesty offered to former privateers by the British government. Teach then took command of his own ship. [PAR] During the next two years, Teach cultivated a reputation for cruelty, repeatedly preying on coastal settlements of the West Indies and the Atlantic coast of North America. He fought a running duel with the British thirty-gun man-of-war HMS Scarborough, which added to his notoriety. [PAR] Blackbeard would plunder merchant ships, forcing them to allow his crew to board their ship. The pirates would seize all of the valuables, food, liquor, and weapons. Ironically, despite his ferocious reputation, there are no verified accounts of him actually killing anyone. He generally prevailed by fear alone. [PAR] However, colourful legends and vivid contemporary newspaper portrayals had him committing acts of cruelty and terror. One tale claims he shot his own first mate, saying ""if he didn’t shoot one or two [crewmen] now and then, they’d forget who he was."" Another legend is that having had too much to drink, he said to his crew, ""Come, let us make a hell of our own, and try how long we can bear it."" Going into the ship's hold, they closed the hatches, filled several pots with brimstone and set it on fire. Soon the men were coughing and gasping for air from the sulphurous fumes. All except Blackbeard scrambled out for fresh air. When Blackbeard emerged, he snarled, ""Damn ye, ye yellow-bellied sapsuckers! I'm a better man than all ye milksops put together!""[citation needed] According to Captain Charles Johnson's A General History of the Robberies & Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates: [PAR] “Before he sailed upon his adventures, he married a young creature of about sixteen years of age . . . and this I have been informed, made Teach's fourteenth wife . . . with whom after he had lain all night, it was his custom to invite five or six of his brutal companions to come ashore, and he would force her to prostitute herself to them all, one after another, before his face.” [PAR] Blackbeard fought armed with multiple swords, knives, and pistols. He is said[citation needed] to have woven lighted matches woven into his famous black beard when going into battle. Eyewitness accounts[citation needed] say he ""looked like the devil"" with his scowling face and smoke clouds around his head. [PAR] Teach had headquarters in both the Bahamas and the Carolinas. He lived on the island of Nassau where he was named the magistrate of the ""Privateers Republic"". Governor Charles Eden of North Carolina received booty from Teach in return for unofficial protection and gave him an official pardon. He left Nassau to avoid meeting with Royal Governor Woodes Rogers, unlike the majority of the pirate inhabitants who welcomed the governor and accepted the royal pardons he brought. [PAR] Teach had apparently retired from piracy. However, Governor Alexander Spotswood of Virginia became concerned that the notorious freebooter lived nearby. Spotswood decided to eliminate Blackbeard, even though he lived outside of Spotswood's jurisdiction.

[PAR] Lesson Transcript [PAR] Instructor: Francesca Marinaro [PAR] Francesca M. Marinaro has a PhD in English from the University of Florida and has been teaching English composition and Literature since 2007. [PAR] In this lesson, you'll learn about Sherlock Holmes, the brilliant, iconic sleuth created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and featured in many of his novels and short stories. You'll also get an introduction to Holmes's crime-solving associate. [PAR] Sherlock Holmes [PAR] Sherlock Holmes is the fictional detective created by Scottish Author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle during the late 19th century. One of the most recognizable figures in English literature, Sherlock Holmes is a consulting detective who lives at 221 B Baker Street in Victorian London and assists clients privately with the help of his friend and roommate, Dr. John H. Watson. Whenever the police have difficulty solving a case, they come seeking Holmes's advice. [PAR] Conan Doyle based the character of Sherlock Holmes on Dr. Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, under whom Conan Doyle had worked as a clerk, though Bell is often quoted as having written to Conan Doyle that, 'You are yourself Sherlock Holmes, and well you know it.' Conan Doyle also drew inspiration from Sir Henry Littlejohn of the University of Edinburgh Medical School. As a police surgeon, Littlejohn created for Conan Doyle a link between the study of medicine and the study of crime. We know very little biographically about the character Sherlock Holmes other than the fact",What is the name of the author of the Sherlock Holmes books?,"['arthur conan doyle', 'sir arthur conan doyle', 'conan doyle']",d422154a04cf4d0fb77a2ff5288ced79,"[{'end': [3047, 3291], 'start': [3030, 3274]}, {'end': [3291, 3047], 'start': [3270, 3026]}, {'end': [3801, 3291, 3961, 4112, 3047, 3672, 3885], 'start': [3791, 3281, 3951, 4102, 3037, 3662, 3875]}]","∃x Wrote(x, SherlockHolmesBooks)"
"[DOC] [TLE] Curious Origins of Nursery Rhymes - Jack and JillCurious Origins of Nursery Rhymes: Jack and Jill | LetterPile [PAR] Curious Origins of Nursery Rhymes: Jack and Jill [PAR] Updated on October 10, 2016 [PAR] Joined: 6 years agoFollowers: 955Articles: 224 [PAR] 36 [PAR] Advertisement [PAR] Jack and Jill [PAR] A mainstay of children's rhyme the world over is the silly little ditty of Jack and Jill, who went up a hill to fetch a pail of water. Now if you are being a scientific pedant, you will know that water is usually found along the syncline of geological rock formations - that is down the hill rather than the anticline i.e., up the hill.  tch. tch. But let's not quibble on matters of teaching kids bad geology. [PAR] As we learnt from the canon of Mother Goose's melody, the enduring nature of these nursery rhymes come from the simplicity, the ease with which they can be memorised and their bouncy melodies. [PAR] No one quite knows how or when Jack and Jill actually came to be. There are many who are happy to speculate and mythologise. Let us separate some facts from the resultant fiction. [PAR] Advertisement [PAR] Jack and Jill - the first three stanzas [PAR] Jack and Jill went up the hill [PAR] To fetch a pail of water.

[PAR] (Mother vexed did whip her next [PAR] For causing Jack's disaster)- later versions [PAR] The Verse [PAR] The first verse is the most popular and familiar one. However, there are versions of the Jack and Jill poem that have 15 stanzas dating back to the 19th century. As someone clearly felt the need to tell 'Jack and Jill : the full untold story.' [PAR] The 19th century chapbook versions have the three stanzas (shown on the right) as the beginning of the Jack and Jill melody. There are mild variations to the second and third stanzas in 20th century versions - given in brackets. [PAR] Did you know that the very early woodcuts pictured Jack and 'Gill' - two boys. Somewhere along the line 'Gil' the boy became 'Jill' the girl, to add some frisson on the climb up to the hill, presumably. [PAR] The name Jack is an archetypal everyman used in many stories ( Jack and the beanstalk, Jack the lad) and the name 'Jill' was used to represent 'a girl next door' or a sweet heart. [PAR] The rhyme itself is a quatrain using the rhyming form 'abcb' with a rising and falling rhythmic melody. [PAR] The use of vinegar and brown paper to bind cuts and bruises was a common practice in middle ages. No one could actually account for the meaning behind the story and in all likelihood it was a nonsense rhyme that has endured because of its simplicity. [PAR] There are many speculations as to the origin of the 'Jack and Jill' story and its metaphorical excursions. [PAR] Advertisement [PAR] Hjuki and Bil [PAR] Hjuki and Bil [PAR] There is an Old Norse myth that tells us the story of the Moon, Mâni, who stole two children from earth, Hjuki and Bil, as they were collecting water from the well, Byrgir, in their bucket, Sœgr, suspended from their pole, Simul. The Moon as an archetypal kidnapper of children sounds eerily ominous and was perhaps told to keep children from wandering about at night. [PAR] Hjuki in Norse is pronounced Juki which could've eventually become Jack. Jill may have replaced Bil for the sake of alliteration. It was suggested by S Baring Gould (in his book about myths and legends) that this story may have eventually birthed the rhyme of Jack and Jill.

"[DOC] [TLE] german8 - The Grim Brothersgerman8 - The Grim Brothers [PAR] german8 [PAR] This is the Grimm Brothers monument in Hanau, Germany. [PAR] This is a book of the Grimm Brothers fairy tales. [PAR] The Grimm Brothers. [PAR] By: Hayley and Haley [PAR] March 25, 2009 [PAR] Today I read some really cool fairy tales that were written by the Grimm brothers. I was really interested in these writers, so I decided to learn some more information about them. I went online and learned about their family. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm had seven brothers and sisters, but only six of them lived through infancy. Jacob was born on January 4, 1785 in Hanau, Germany. Wilhelm was born on February 24, 1786. The two brothers had grown up and worked with each other cooperatively. Wilhelm died on December 16, 1859, at the age of 73. Jacob died on September 20, 1863, at the age of 78. [PAR] March 26, 2009 [PAR] I did more research on the Grimm brothers. Today I learned about many of the stories they wrote. The stories that the brothers Grimm wrote were not from their own fantasy. In fact, they collected quite a bit of their stories from young, literate, middle class women. The brothers published their first book in 1812 entitled ""Kinder-und Hausmärchen"". In English that translates to Children's and Household Tales. It contained 86 fairy tales. Then in 1814 they published a second volume of the book with the same name. This book had 90 stories in it. [PAR] March 27, 2009 [PAR] I also found out today that they wrote a another book also called Children's and Household Tales, that became published in 1814, but later became known as the Book of Grimm's Fairy Tales. Not many people know that there even is a book called Children's and Household Tales, even though they own a copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales. [PAR] March 30, 2009 [PAR] I was sick for the past couple of days so I got a lot of time to research on the web. I found out that the brothers had written stories like Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White and Red Rose, The Glass Coffin, and The Crystal Ball. They have written 210 stories all together. These stories were very popular and still are. 200 of the 210 stories are stories but 10 of them are so-called child legends. [PAR] March 31, 2009 [PAR] Today was my last day of research and I learned that Disney had taken some of the Grimm fairy tales and changed them into different stories and movies. Disney had taken Snow White and Red Rose and turned it into Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. They also took Cinderella and turned it into a short feature and then a full length feature. [PAR] April 1, 2009 [PAR] Today I went online again to see where a good place the Grimm Brothers' books are and it turns out most of their books are in Hanau, Germany, where they grew up. And because today is my birthday, my friends and family saw how interested I am in the Grimm Brothers and their history, they gave me plane tickets to Hanau, Germany so I can find out more cool facts about them! I'm so excited but the sad part is that I won't be able to talk to you (my Journal) for a few days. [PAR] April 5, 2009 [PAR] Well, here I am, in Germany. It's so beautiful here and I already read/bought 5 Grimm books! I went and saw the monument of the Grimm Brothers and got a picture of it. It made me want to read another book. I read Rumpelstiltskin and did some research and found that it was made about a girl one of the grimm brothers met. I am going home now because I think I learned everything that there is to know about them. [PAR] Jakob Karl Grimm was born on January 4, 1785, in Hanau, Germany. [PAR] His brother, Wilhelm Karl Grimm, was born on February 24 of the following year.

"[DOC] [TLE] Sandra Bullock Photos, Gossip, Bio & Review - AskMenSandra Bullock Photos, Gossip, Bio & Review - AskMen [PAR] AskMen [PAR] Messages You have no messages [PAR] Notifications You have no notifications [PAR] Sandra Bullock [PAR] Sandra Bullock [PAR] The moment that she took over the steering wheel in Speed (1994) to help a busload of people deal with a mad bomber, Sandra Bullock sent her career into overdrive and became America's Next Big Thing. The ""new"" Julia Roberts when Julia Roberts hit a temporary career roadblock, Sandra Bullock reached significant fame through movies like While You Were Sleeping (1995) and Miss Congeniality (2000). [PAR] One of Hollywood's old reliable go-to girls for romantic comedies, Sandra Bullock has remained a popular cinematic option for both sexes at the multiplex. Following a brief dry spell, she's coming off her most successful year to date -- no doubt due to the combined smashes, The Proposal (2009) and The Blind Side (2009), taking home the Oscar for Best Actress for the latter. [PAR] Just when life for the 45-year-old actress seemed like it couldn't get any better, Sandra Bullock was ""blindsided"" by Michelle ""Bombshell"" McGee , a tattoo model who went to In Touch magazine with a story of her alleged affair with Bullock's husband Jesse James -- an affair that apparently took place while Bullock was filming The Blind Side. Bullock moved out of her home with James and filed for divorce. [PAR] This personal stumbling block did nothing to slow down her career however, as she starred in the Academy Award-nominated film based on Jonathan Safran Foer's Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close in 2011, box office comedy hit The Heat and  arguably the biggest movie of 2013, Gravity, for which she is nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. [PAR] Appeal [PAR] Sandra Bullock got an early taste of heartbreak and rejection when she was given the boot by her boyfriend in the sixth grade for having a small chest, but in the years since her high school classmates chose her as ""Most Likely to Brighten Up Your Day,"" she has become Hollywood's classic girl next door -- even if she is 45. In her case, age doesn't matter, because a lot of men would still love to give her the attention that her sixth grade boyfriend wouldn't. A three-time member of the Most Beautiful People club in People, Sandra Bullock maintains a youthful physique to go along with her easy charisma through the joys of acupuncture. [PAR] Having made the choice long ago to keep her private life private, Sandra Bullock doesn't like to discuss her romantic relationships where prying eyes can see them. Once engaged to fellow actor Tate Donovan and previously linked to Ryan Gosling and Matthew McConaughey , she eventually settled down when she married Jesse James . However, she filed for divorce in 2010 after information about James' affairs with other women during their marriage came out. [PAR] The couple had intended to adopt a child together, and after the split, Bullock proceeded with the adoption of her new son Louis Bardo Bullock as a single mom. [PAR] Success [PAR] Sandra Bullock is a performer who discovered her niche -- romantic comedies -- and learned how to make the most of it. Following the buzz generated by her breakthrough hit, Speed, Sandra Bullock's baked her career bread and butter through successful chick flicks that ranged from Miss Congeniality with Benjamin Bratt to Two Weeks Notice (2002) with Hugh Grant . While her efforts to occasionally break free of cute comedy typecasting haven't always gone her way -- see Murder by Numbers (2002), Gun Shy (2000) and 28 Days (2000) for more information there -- She has used her roles in Crash (2004), The Blind Side (2009), and most recently Gravity (2013) to show off a strong, dramatic and Oscar-worthy side that has put her back in the top ranks of Hollywood's most successful modern actresses. That doesn't mean Bullock is done with comedy entirely however, as she starred alongside Melissa McCarthy in the top-grossing comedy of 2013, The Heat.
